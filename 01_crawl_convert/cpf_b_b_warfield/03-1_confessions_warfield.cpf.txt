[P000001] VI. AUGUSTINE AND HIS" CONFESSIONS." 'j,HERE is probably no man of the ancient world, of whose outward and inward life alike we possess such full and instructive knowledge as of Augustine's. His extraordinarily voluminous literary product teems with information about himself: and the. writings of his contemporaries and successors provide at least the usual quota of allusions. But in his case these are supplemented by two remarkable -books.

He is accordingly the first of the Christian fathers, the dates of ~hOse birth and death we can exactly determine, and whose' entire development we can follow from-as we say-the cradle to the grave. ~ The simple facts of his uneventful external life are soon told.

Thus the precious doctrine and sweet odor of Christ was diffused throughout all Africa, and even the Church across the sea rejoiced when she heard it,-for, even as when one member suffers all the members suffer with it, so when one member is exalted all the members rejoice with it."* The labors he thus began as a presbyter, we are told, he but completed as bishop, the Lord crowning his work for the peace of the Church with the most astonishing success: "And more and more, by the help of Christ, was increased and multiplied the unity, of peace and the fraternity of the Church of God. . . . . And all this good, as I have said, was both begun and br'ought to a completion by this holy man, with the aid of our bishops."t .. ;-~ But alag! while m3,n may propose it is God that disposes. Scarcely had this hard-won pax ecclesice been attained, when the Vanda 1 invagion Ca'1l3 and with it the ruin of the land. As the fabric he h3,d built up fell about him, the great builder passes away also, and Possidiug draws for us the picture of his last days with a tender:ness of touch which only a true friend could show:t "We talked together very frequently and discussed the tremendous judgment of God enacted under our eyes, saying, 'Just art Thou, 0 God, and Thy judgmen t is righteous.' Mingling our grief and groans and tears we prayed the Father of mercies and God of all consolation to vouchsafe to help us in our trouble. And it chanced on a day as we sat at the table with him and conversed, that he sa~d, 'Bear in mind that I am asking God in this our hour of tribulation, either to deign to deliver this town from the enemy that is investing it, or, if that seems not good to Him, to strengthen His servants to submit themselves to His will, and in any event to take me away from this world to Himself.' Under his instruction it became therefore our custom thereafter, and that of all connected with us, and of those who were in the town, to join with him in such a prayer to God Almig~ty. And behold, in the third month of the siege, he took to his bed, afflicted with a fever; and thus fell into his last illness. Nor did the Lord disappoint His servant of the fruit of his prayer ..... Thus did this holy man, his path prolonged by the Divine bounty for the advantage and happiness of the Church,Jiy_eseventy and six years, almost forty of which were spent in the priest- ~qod.~.£l2fj~: He 'had b;-;;;-M;cu~tOmed to'say"to-lisTrlfamiliar convers"a:' twn, that no baptized person, even though he were a notable Christian and a priest, should depart from the body without fitting and sufficient penitence. So he looked to this in his last sickness, of which he died. For he ordered that those few Paalm3 of David called Penitential should be written out and the sheets containing them hung upon the wall where he could see them ~s he lay in bed, in his weakness; and as he read them he wept constantly and abundantly. And that he might not be disturbed, he asked of us who were present, some ten days before he departed from the body, that no one should come in except at those hours * Vita, etc., ch. vii. tCh. xiii. t Chs. xxviii, xxix, xxxi.

Unintermittently, up to the outbreak of this last illness, he had zealously and energetically prea;ched in the church the Word of God, with sanity of mind and soundness of judgment. And now, preserved to a good old age, sound in all the members of his body, and with unimpaired sight and hearing, and with us, as it is written, standing by and looking on and uniting with him in prayer, he fell asleep with his fathers: and we offered a sacrifice to God for the due disposition of his body and buried him." His library, the biography proceeds, he left to the Church; and his own books, who that reads them can fail to read in them the manner of man he was? "But I think," he adds,-* "But I think that those could profit more from him who could hear and see him speaking as he stood in the church, especially If they were not ignorant of his walk among men. For he was not merely a learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven, bringing out from his treasury things new and old, and one of those merchantmen who, having found a pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it; but he was also of those to whom it is written, 'So speak and so do,' and of whom the Saviour says, 'Whosoever shall do and teach men thus, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." "- What a testimony is this to Augustine's daily life before his companions! And how pathetic is this companion's parting request of his readers,- "Pray with me and for me, that I may both in this world become the emulator and imitator of this man with whom for almost forty years, by God's grace, I lived in intimacy and happiness, without any unpleasant disagreement, and in the future may enjoy with him the promises of God Almighty." n.-THE "CONFESSION'S" OF AUGUSTINE.

There is laid bare to us in it a human heart with a completeness of self-revelation probably unparalleled in literature. Jean Jacques Rousseau, to be sure, claims this distinction for his own Confessions. Ii I have entered on a performance," says he, "which is without example, whose accomplishment will have no imitator. I mean to present my fellow-mortals 'with a man in all the integrity of nature; and this man shall be myself." Rousseau has at least the merit of perceiving what many have not recognized, that his book cannot be considered to belong to the same class of * eh. xxxi.
[P000005] AUGUSTINE AND HIS "CONFESSIONS." 85 literature with Augustine's. But what we wish now to emphasize is that even as an unveiling of the soul of a man, which it makes its sole object, Rousseau's performance falls far behind Augustine's searching pages, although, as we shall see, self-revelation was in these merely an incidental effect. The truth is, Rousseau did not see deeply enough and could not command a prospect sufficiently wide to paint all that is in man, even all that is in such a man as he essayed to portray. Quite apart from the interval that separates the two souls depicted, Rousseau's conception of self-revelation rose little above exhibiting himself with his clothes off. To his prurient imagination nakedness, certainly unadorned and all the better if it were unadorning, appeared" the most poignant possible revelation of humanity. It seemed to him, essential scandal-monger that he was, that he needed but to publish on the housetop all his "adventures" to enable the whole world to say of him in the Roman proverb, Ego te intus et in cute nO'IJi " and he was only too pleased to believe that the world, on so seeing his inward disposition at least if not his outward life, would be convinced that it agreed well with" loose N atta' s."* _ He could feel no:~x.mpathx w~!E-~.';lE~i~~,~~crYl,_(~Lpe~ame ~rt}ightYPJlz,zJe to myself."t The shallow self he knew only too well absorbed his entire attention and his one engagement was in presenting this self to the gaze of the public.

There will be few rea~ers who will easily per_~;uade themselves that what they read all happened, o~~ned as it is set down; they will rather be continually haunted with the sus~ picion that they are perusing not a veracious autobiography but a piccaroon novel. The interval that divides the Confessions of Rousseau from the Adventures of Gil Blas of Santillane is, in any case, narrower than that which separates it from the Confessions oS Augustine. It must be confessed, it is true, that, if not the sincerity, at least th~t!ul?t;-(;rth~ of .the~po~:t;alt-Augustmedraws oI hImself also ,~::l§,Ao,tRassed whOTiyunquestloned.

SCHMID in an article entitled "Zur Bekehrungsgeschichte Augustins" in the Zeitschrift fur Theologie und Kirche, 1897, VII, pp. 80-96, has made the fact and extent of failure of the Confessions in trustworthiness the subject of a special study. No one doubts, he remarks, the subjective sincerity of the Confessions; and its objective trustworthiness can come into question only in minutire. The conclusion at which he arrives is that only in two points are the Confessions open to correction in their representation. Augustine was not led to give up his professorship by his conversion, but these two things fell together only by accident; and he still wished after conversion for a comfortable life, an otium cum dignitate, and loved to teach. "Thus in realitv there remains, so far as the Confessions do not correct themselves-that is, pe~mit the history to be seen through the veil of later reflections thro'wn over it-very little over.

Th judgment that Augustine passed on the misdeeds not merely, but the whole course, of his youth was naturally essentially different at the\ time when he wrote his, Confessions from what it had been Jiuring the life which is passed in review in them. He does not leave us to infer this-he openly declares it; or rather it is precisely this ~hange of judgment which it is one of the chief purposes of the Confessions to signalize. We could hardly ask a man after he has escaped from what he has come to look upon as the sty to write of his mode~of life in it from the poinj;oLyiew.!?L2Q~3Y!lliJQ~et'L to wallow in the mire. It is, however, something very like this that is suggested by our critics as the ideal of autobiographical narration. At least we read: "About the year 400, when the Confessions were written, Augustine had arrived at a most lofty conceptien of duty and life; he commits the usual and inevitable fallacy of taking this later standard back to illumine the ground of his early career. In the glare of his new ideal, actions which probably implied no moral resistance at the time they were performed, cast an appalling shadow."t And again: "There is no trace in the Confessions that his conscience had anything to say at the time·"t -' Surely there is laid here a most unreasonable requirement upon the historian.

It is important, however, in order that we may appraise the book properly, to apprehend somewhat more exactly than perhaps is common precisely what Augustine proposed to himself in it. It is inadequate to speak of it simply either broadly as an autobiography, or more precisely as a vie intime. Not to emphasize just here the decisive consideration that only nine of its thirteen books have any biographical content, it lies quite on the face of the narrative that e.Y.~Il._~h~.~i(~g!aphical m~!~.!:~al prov~ded in these nine books is not given with a purely biographical intent.

In sending a copy of the book, almost a generation later, to a distinguished and admiring friend who had asked him for it, he does indeed speak of it frankly as a mirror in which he himself could be seen; and, be it duly noted, he affirms that he is to be seen in this mirror truly, just as he ,vas.

At the head of his narrative Newton has written this text: "Thou shalt remember all the way, by which the Lord thy God led thee through this wilderness"; and the same text might equally well be written at the head of Augustine's Confessions. We might almost fancy we hear Augustine explaining his own purpose when we hear Newton declaring that with him it was a question "only concerning the patience and long-suffering of God, the wonderful interposition of His providence in favor of an unworthy sinner, the power of His grace in softening the hardest heart, and the riches of His mercy in pardoning the most enormous and aggravated transgressions," PerhtliQs, however, the c!.<?_~~t~nal()gy to Augustine's Confessions, among books, at least, which have attained anythingJ}~~~.he-sa_iE~~:22i~~fu1:~j~fI~~nce~ Is furnished by John Bunyan's Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.

For we must not fancy that when Augustine has brought to a completion the narrative of the wonderful dealings of God with him, by which he was led to repentance, he has ended his "confessions" ; to which he attaches the last four books therefore purely mechanically, without any rational bond of connection with their predecessors. To his consciousness, throughout the whole extent of these books, he continues to sound the voice of his confessions: and if we search in them for it we shall find the same note ringing in them as in the others. "Behold," he cries,* "Thy voice is my joy: Thy voice surpasses the abundance of pleasures. . . .'. Let me confess unto Thee whatsoever I have found in Thy booh, and let me hear the voice of praise, and drink Thee in and consider the wonderful things of Thy law, even from the beginning, in the which Thou didst make the heaven and the earth, down to the everlasting kingdom of Thy Holy City, that is with Thee."

West points out that this species of composition was especially Roman. "Autobiography, as well as satire," he remark~, "should be credited to the Romans as their own independent invention." "The appearance of Augustine's Confessions, in 399 or 400," he continues, "dates the entrance of a new kind of autobiography into Latin literature,-the autobiography of introspection, the self-registered record of the development of a human soul." It was characteristic of Augustine's genius that, in a purely incidental use of it, he invented an entirely new literary form and carried it at a stroke to its highest development. No wonder that Harnack falls into something like enthusiasm over this accomplishment. "The significance of the 'Confessions,''' says he, "is as great on the side of form as on that of contents. Before all, they were a literary achievement. No poet, no philosopher before Augustine had undertaken what he here performed; and I may add that almost a thousand years had to 'pass before a similar thing was done. It was the poets of the Renascence, who formed themselves on Augustine, who first gained from his example the daring to depict themselves and to present their personality to the world. For what do the Confessions of Augustine contain? The portrait of a soul-not psychological disquisitions on the Understanding, the 'Will and the Emotions in Man, not abstract investigations into the nature of the soul, not superficial reasonings and moralizing introspections like the "Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, but the most exact portraiture of a distinct human personality, in his development from childhood to full age, with all his propensities, feelings, aims, mistakes; a portrait of a soul, in fact, drawn with a perfection of observation that leaves on one side the mechanical devices of psychology, and pursues the methods of the physician and the physiologist."t Obviously Harnack is thinking of the first nine books only. Otherwise he could scarcely speak so absolutely of the absence from the Confessions of "psychological disquisitions." For what is the great discourse on "Memory," embodied in the tenth book, but a psychological disquisition of the most penetrating kind, to say nothing now of the analysis of the idea of "Time," broached in the eleventh book? The achievement which he signalizes is, therefore, only part of the achievement of the book, and if Augustine in it has incidentally become the father of all those who have sought to paint the portrait of a human soul, what must be sam of the originality of his performance when understood in its real peculiarity-as the .dramatic portraiture of the dealing of Divine Grace with a sinful soul in leading it through all its devious wanderings into the harbor of salvation? Not in the poets of the Renascence-not even in Goethe's Faust in which Harnack strangely * Presbyterian and Reformed Review, April, 1901, p. 183, top. cit., pp. 127-128.
[P000014] 94 THE PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL REVIEW. seeks the nearest literary parallel to the Confessions-can it now find its tardy successors. We must come down to the Reformation -perhaps to the "second Reformation" as the men of the seventeenth century loved to call their own times, and after that to that almost third Reformation which was wrought by the "Evangelical Revival" or "Great Awakening"-before we discover its real successors: and we must look through all the years, perhaps in vain, to find any successor worthy to be placed on a level with it. We must avoid exaggeration, however, even with respect to the novelty of the book. Perhaps if we eliminate the question of value and think merely of the literary species which it so uniquely represents, it can scarcely be said that Augustine's performance was absolutely without forerunners, or remained absolutely without successors "for a thousand years." The greatness of its shining may blind our eyes unduly to lesser points of light, which, except for the glare of its brilliancy, might be seen to stud the heavens about it. A recent writer, for example, claims for a tractate of Cyprian's-the treatise or letter "To Donatus"-the honor of having pointed out the way in which Augustine afterward walked. "Finally," says he,* "a great novelty appears in this little book. The pages on the conversion of Cyprian, which mark almost the advent of a new species of literature, directly herald the Confessions of St. Augustine. For a long time, a very profane manner of life, a passionate taste for pleasure, along with a sort of instinctive defiance of Christianity; subsequently, up to the very eve of the decisive event, incapacity to believe in the renewal promised in baptism, a very clear perception of the obstacles which a life so worldly opposed to so sudden a revolution; then, after many hesitations, grace, as startling as a clap of thunder, revolutionizing the whole being in its profoundest depths, to turn it toward a new destiny; and in the recollection left by this miraculous transformation, a fixed determination to refer all to God, to turn confession into acts of thankfulness: such are in Cyprian the essential traits that mark the steps of conversion. And these are precisely the ideas that dominate the Confessions of Augustine." In effect, we have in this affected, mincing tract of Cyprian's, hidden as its lessons well-nigh are under the shadow of its rhetorical virtuosity, what may be called the beginnings of the Autobiography of Conversion-unless we prefer to penetrate yet a hundred years further back and see its beginnings in the beautiful description with which Justin Martyr opens his Dialogue with Trypho of how he found his way through philosophy to Christ. Both narratives have much in their substance that is fitted to remind of Augustine's. But both are too brief; the one is too objective and the other too affected; neither is sufficiently introspective or sufficiently searching to )ustify their inclusion in the same class with their * MONCEAUX, Hist.

[P000015] AUGUSTINE AND HIS "CONFESSIONS." 95 great successor. A better claim, many will think, might be put in for the spiritual history which Hilary of Poictiers gives of his own former life in the splendid Latin of the first fifteen sections of his treatise On the Faith or, as it is commonly called, On the Trinity. It is the story of a naturally noble soul, seeking and gradually finding more and more perfectly the proper aim of life as it rises to the knowledge first of the God of philosophy and then of the God of revelation, and ultimately attains assured faith in the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Did it not move so exclusively on the intellectualistic plane, without depth of experimental coloring, its dignity of language and high eloquence might, despite its brevity, justify us in esteeming it no unworthy forerunner of the Confessions. Such predecessors, interesting as they are and valuable as marking the channels in which the new Christian literature naturally flowed, can hardly be thought of as having opened the way for Augustine-partly because their motive is too primarily autobiographical. Similarly he had few immediate successors who can be said to follow closely in his steps. Perhaps the Eucharisticos Deo of Paulinus of Pella-in which he essays to praise God for His preservation of him and for His numerous kindnesses through a long and eventful life-may not unfairly be considered a typical instance of such spiritual autobiographies as the next age produced. This poem is assuredly not uninteresting, and to the student of manners it has its own importance; but as a history of a soul it lacks nearly everything that gives to the Confessions their charm. That some resemblance should be discernible between the picture Augustine draws of his life and that which such writers draw of their own was unavoidable, since he and they were ~like men and Christians and were prepared to thank God for making them both. But the resemblance ends very much at that "point. The sublime depths and heights of Augustine and all that has made him the teacher of the world in this his most individual book is wanting, as well in his 'Successors as in his predecessors. He had to wait for Bunyan before there was written anot~e!,,~~ch spi~itual "autobiography," or to b~'~~-pr~-ci;e;" another,_~~§h-hI~tory of God's dealinp"s ~~th~~-;;ul: ande~~~ the G ..

Nevertheless the form of the Confessions is itself not without its fascination, and its very style has also its allurement. His rhetorical training had entered, to be sure, into Augustine's verysubsfance and 'the"faJsetasfe-,~itli-wlllch he had been imbued had become a second nature with him. Even in such heart-throes as express themselves in this book, he could not away with the frivolous word-plays, affected assonances, elaborate balancing of clauses and the like that form the hall-mark of the sophistic rhetoric of the times. It has been remarked that "rhetorician as Augustine was, and master of several styles, he had a curious power of dropping his rhetoric when he undertook in homilies and commentaries to interpret Scripture."t Unfortunately, he also had a curious facility of dropping into offensive rhetorical tricks in the midst of the most serious discussions, or the most moving revelations of feeling. Apart from these occasional lapses-if lapses so frequent can be called occasional-the very form given this book as a sustained address to God is wearisome to many. M. Boissiert remarks that the transports and effusions with which Augustine addresses himself to God" end by seeming to us monotonous." Harnack thinks the book too long and too alien to modern thought ever to enter into really literary use in its entirety: and therefore welcomes the preparation of abridgments of it.§ Prof. Westll finds in it "ineptitudes and infelicities" which can be expected to shrink and permit" the central power" of the book to appear only for him who reads it in its original Latin. The merely English reader, he remarks, can scarcely hope to find it very interesting. "The unchecked rhetoric, the reiterated calls on God, varied and wearisome, the shrewd curiosity in hunting down subtleties to their last hidingplaces, the streaks of inane allegorizing, ~ and sometimes the violent bursts of feeling,-these are the things that frighten away readers and prevent them from reaching the real delights of the book."

It is not, indeed, as Dr. Bigg justly adds, either "so compact or so highly polished" as the Imitation of Christ: "St. Augustine cannot give the time to cut each word as if it were an individual diamond, as a Kempis did." But Augustine more than compensates for this deficiency in preciosity by his greater richness, depth, and variety. There is nothing effeminate in Augustine's style, nothing over-filed, nothing cloying or wearisome. Here, too, indeed, it is true, as it generally is; that the style is the man.

Adolf Harnack, realizing the immensesignificance of the appearance in Augustine of this new type of religion, consecrates a whole chapter in his History ot.

The fact of the matter is that pre-Augustinian Christian thinking was largely engrossed with Theological and Christological problems

It is to the fact that rin this book we are admitted into the very life of Augustine and are permitted to see his great heart cleansing itself of all trust in himself and laying hold with the grasp first of despair, then of discerning trust and then of grateful love upon the God who was his salvation, that the Confessions owe their perennial attractiveness and their supreme position among books of edification. In them Augustine uncovers his heart and lets us see what religion is in its essence as it works in the soul of one who has, as few have, experienced its power. He has set himself determinedly in this bookto exhibit the grace ofGOd1n>-action.'~'"E[~ew~ has ~poUlldedit~Tn-- theory, defended it against its assailants, enforced it with logical argument and moving exhortation.

This is the meaning and this is the extent of the autobiographical element in the Confessions. Nine of the thirteen books are devoted to this religious analysis of his life-history; and although, of course, the matter admitted and its treatment alike are determined by the end in view, yet Augustine's analysis is very searching and the end in view involves a very complete survey of all that was especially determining in his life-development.

It may repay us to run over the salient elements in this life-history as here depicted for us.

(By the time Augustine had reached his seventeenth birthday (autumn of 371) we find him already attached to her who was to be the companion of his life for the next fourteen ye~ in a union which, though not marriage in the highest sense, differed from technical marriage rather in a legal than in a moral point of view. Though he himself, later at least, did not look upon such a union as true marriage,* it was esteemed its equivalent not only in the best heathen society of the time, but even in certain portions of the Church, perhaps up to his own day by the entire Church;t and it served to screen him from the multitudinous temptations to vice that otherwise would have beset him. "I was faithful to her," he says.t It was an overmastering and lofty ambition, not fleshly lust, that constituted the real power in his life, and these years of preparation at Carthage were years of strenuous labor, during which Augustine was ever growing toward his higher ideals. Already in his nineteenth year (373) he was incited to lay aside his lower ambitions by the reading of a book of Cicero's, since lost, § which had been designed to inflame the heart of the reader with a love of philosophy and which wrought so powerfully on Augustine that he resolved at once to make pure truth thenceforward the sole object of his pursuit.

[P000024] 104 THE PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to receive him back into the family circle when she became convinced that his defection was not hopeless. Monnica has been made the object of much severe and, as it seems to us, scarcely intelligent criticism for her action on this occasion. It has been sneeringly remarked, for example, that she did not object very much to Augustine's cherishing a concubine, but did object violently to his cherishing a heresy. "She seems to have accepted his companion without a murmur," says a recent writer,* "but the descent into heresy was an unpardonable depth." We shall raise no question here of the validity of Bacon's dictum, that "it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandaIs; yea, more than corruption of manners." In any event the antithesis is unwisely chosen. 0Ve have seen that no great moral obliquity attached to such concubinage as Augustine's, which was, in fact, only an inferior variety of marriage: and though, no doubt, this entanglement was deeply regretted by Monnica, whose ambition for her son had earlier forbidden her providing him with a wife, yet it is quite likely that she saw no reason seriously to reprobate a relation which not only the law of the State, but probably that of the Church, too, acknowledged as legitimate .. On the other hand, it is unfair not to recognize the immense change which Augustine's step wrought in his attitude to the religion which was his mother's very life. He may have been up to this moment both indifferent and even of evil life. But he had remained at least formally a Christian; he was still a catechumen; and there was ever hope of repentance. Now he had formally apostatized. He had not only definitively turned his back on Christianity, but was actively assailing it with scorn and ridicule, and that with such success that he was drawing his circle of friends away with him. t :It was, says Augustine,t "because she hated and detested the blas- . phemies of his error" that she had broken off fellowship with hiflD Surely his mother's horror is not inexplicable; and it is to be remembered that her attitude of renunciation of intercourse was at once reversed on the reintroduction of hope for her son into her heart. Nor did she ever cease to pursue him with her tears and her prayers. § * MCCABE, op. cit., p. 66. t In the De duabus anim., ch. ix, Augustine tells of the effect his easy victory over the ignorant Catholics had in hardening him in his error. :j: Contt., II, xi, 19. § It is probably not necessary to r~ert here to the fact that Manicheism was not merely under the ban of the Church, but also under that of the State-that it was crime as well as heresy. The" severe and bloody laws enacted against them by Valentini an, A.D. 372, Theodosius, A.D. 381," repeating, possibly, the earlier proscription of Diocletian, A.D. 287 (see STOKES, Smith & Wace, III, 799), do
[P000025] A UGUSTINE AND HIS" CONFESSIONS." 105 Despite the eagerness with which he cast himself into the arms of the Manicheans and the zeal with which he became their advocate, Augustine had had very little grounding in the debatable questions that lay at the base of the system.

His sudden discovery in the teachings of the Manicheans of the "wisdom" he had been inflamed to seek, was therefore liable to a rude shock of awaking when his studies in the liberal sciences, on which he now zealously entered, should begin to bear fruit.

So far as his outward fortunes were concerned Augustine was now at last in a fair way to realize the ambitions which had been the determining force in his life.t Driven from Thagaste 'by a burning heart, racked with grief for a lost friend; and then successively from Carthage and Rome by chagrin over the misbehavior of his pupils; he cannot be said hitherto to have attained a position of solid consequence. Whatever reputation he may have acquired as a teacher, whatever applause he may have gained in the practice of his art, whatever triumphs he may have secured in public contests,t were all by the way, and left him still a "viator" rather than a "consummator."

It appeared no difficult matter to obtain some permanent preferment-through his host of influential friends a governorship might easily be had; and then a wife with a little money to help toward expenses could be taken; and the height of his desire would be reached.§ Things were set in train to consummate this plan; a suitable maiden was sought and found and the betrothment concluded; I! and everything was apparen'lty progressing to his taste.

Thus was I sick and tormented, reproaching myself more bitterly than ever, twisting and writhing in my chain, until it should be entirely broken, since now it held me but slightly-though it held me yet ....

And not indeed in these words, but to this purport, I cried to Thee incessantly, ''But Thou, 0 Lord, how long? How long, 0 Lord? Wilt Thou be angry forever? 0 remember not against us our iniquities of old!' I felt myself held by them: I raised sorrowful cries: 'How long, How long? Tomorrow, and to-morrow? Why not now, why not this instant, end my wickedness?'

I choked back the rush of tears and rose, interpreting it no otherwise than as a divine command to me to open the book and read whatever passage I first lighted upon. For I had heard of Anthony, that he had received the admonition from the Gospel lesson which he chanced to come in upon, as if what was read was spoken to himself: 'Go, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me'; and was at once converted by this oracle to Thee. So I returned quickly to the place where Alypius was sitting, for I had laid down the volume of the apostle there when I left him. I seized it, opened it, and read in silence the passage on which my eyes first fell: 'Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and'eIlvYiE~.~llt put ye on tEe Lord Jes':lcf-Cfi~~(Lpal(~:ri:?§,£r,~iI~i<?nlor the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof!

He says (Herzog.s, II, 267) that there must have happened something between Augustine's adoption of Neoplatonism at a time when he still lived in concubinage and his decisive revulsion from all sexual life, witnessed in the Soliloquies (1. 10,

This is theaccollllttogn;eofthaic'C;Iorlng of seli=-iwcusatlon that is thrown over the narrative which is so offensive to some of its readers; as if Augustine were set upon painting his life in the blackest tints imaginable, and wished us to believe that his "quiet and honest youth" and strenuous and laborious manhood, marked as they really were by noble aspiration and adequate performance, were rather" all sin": nay, that the half-instinctive acts of his infancy itself and the very vitality of his boyish spirits were b6tTh . ~-vents which a peculiarly sinful nature formed for itself.

[P000033] AUGUSTINE AND HIS "CONFESSIONS." 113 With his conversion, therefore, the narrative of the Confessions culminates and practically ends. There follows, indeed, another book of narration in which he tells us briefly of his preparation for baptism and of the baptism itself and its meaning to him; but' chiefly of his mother and of that remarkable conversation he held with her at Ostia in which they fairly scaled heaven together in their ardent aspirations; and then of how he laid her away with a heart full of appreciation of her goodness :and of his loss. And then, in yet another book, he undertakes to tell us not what he was, but what he had become, but quickly passes into such searching psychological and ethical analyses that the note of autobiography is lost. Not in this book, then, is the revelation of what Augustine had become to be found; it is rather given us by means of the narrative which fills the first nine books, in the judgment he passes there on his former self and in the cries of gratitude he raises there to God for the great deliverance he had wrought in his soul. We see without difficulty that this new Augustine who is writing is a diffefl?Ut Augustine from him whom he depicts in the narrative: we !:lee that it is even a different Augustine from him whom he leaves with us at the end of the narrative-after his conversion, and his emergence from his country retreat for baptism, and his return to his native Africa. And yet we see also that the making Qf this new Augustine was in essence completed at the point where the narrative leaves him. Whatever development came after this came in the processes of natural growth, and argues no essential change. IV.-THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUGUSTINE.

He entered at this time into no such refutation of N eoplatonism: this was reserved for the teeming pages of the City of God.

It has become quite common to mark off in it quite a series of definite changes. Thus we readt that it was only" on his entrance upon a clerical career," that is, only on his ordination as presbyter in 391, that Augustine entered upon a new phase of thought, marked by increasing knowl- .edge of the Scriptures and deepening Church feeling; and only on his consecration as bishop, late in 395, that he at length attained in principle that complete system of thought which we know as " Augustinianism." Even greater detail is sometimes attempted with respect to the development of the preepiscopal period. The presbyterial period (391-395) is appropriately called" the last section of his apprenticeship," and the preceding four or five years are subdivided into the period between conversion and baptism in which the first place is given to reason and the effort is to conciliate religion with philosophy; and the period from baptism to ordination in which the first place is given to Scripture and the effort has come to be to conciliate philosophy with religion.t Four successive epochs in Augustine's, thought are .. thus distin- 1l1~~ftio:~~~;~s t::sg~~ss;~:-;~:t~!~~~~~:~~t~f- Scripture to its rightful pla,'ce' as primary source of divine knowl- .edge: and these four epochs are sharply divided from one another by external occurrences in Augustine's life,,:~his baptism, ordination as presbyter, and consecration as bishop~- , It is scarcely possible-}to avoid the impression that the scheme of development thus outlined suffers from over-precision and undue elaboration.

Augustine's conversion occurred in the late summer of 386: th~·treatise On jjivers Questions to Simplicianus, in which itis allowed on all hands that" Augustinianism" appears, in principle, in its completeness, was written before the end of 396. Only ten years are available, then, for a development which is supposed to run through four well-marked stages. The exact synchronism of the periods of development with changes of importance in the external conditions of Augustine's life raises further suspicion: there seems to be nothing either in the external changes fitted to produce the internal ones, or in the internal changes to produce the external ones. We begin to wonder whether the assumed internal" development" may not -belargely an-illusion producecr-merelyby The-gradual shifting orlnterest~acc'ompanled by1Jle~naturaraa:Justments ofemphasis, which~a~Tne~itable in the passage of a laymanto·official positions in the ChurcilOfIncreaslngresp()nsibjTlty~Cofor Is-gIven to this suggestion by the actWilSerles'-oftreatises'proceeding from each of these periods of Augustine's life.

But this answer must be returned with some discrimination. It is not meant, of course, that the substance of these books is made up of such sentences, even in the sense in which this is true, say, of the Confessions. What is meant is that these books, being of an entirely different character from, say, the Confessions, and ;written to sub serve an entirely different purpose, yet betray this fundamental note throbbing behind the even flow of their own proper discourse, and thus manifest themselves as the product of a soul which was resting wholly upon its God. We must profess our inability fully to understand the standpoint of those who read these earliest books as the lucubrations of a Neoplatonic philosopher throwing over the mere expression of his thoughts a thin veil of Christian forms. Plainly it is not the philosopher, only slightly touched by Christianity, that is speaking in them, but the Christian theologian, who finds all his joy in the treasures he has:discovered in his newly gained faith. Through the Socratic severity of their philosophical discourse-which is, after all, but the stillness: after the storm-there continually breaks the undercurrent of suppressed emotion.

As we read on from bOQk to book we do not fail to feel, even within the limits of his lay life, a gradual deepening and widening of his knowledge of Scripture, and under the influence of this growing knowledge, a gradual modification of his opinions philosophical and theological alike, and even a gradual change in his very style.* IIi~ c~arliest \yri I contain indications enough 01 crudi- Lies of thought which were subsequently transcended. vVe do not need to advert here to such peripheral matters as his confession that he cannot understand why mrants are baptIzed. r Despite the passion of his dependence on God and the vigor of his reference to God -aione-oranthatTsg~ha(rnotthroughoCutthis ,vl1;;le perio(Ciea~ned to exclude the human inmafue"'frOmthe~Rrocess~ salvation -Tt~~iC "God d~es not have mercy," he say~:Ci;u~l~s~ the will has' precedecf~'ft belongs' to us-to believe and to will, but to HIm -to gIve-to those thatbeileve-ancfwliCtlle-power- to do well, through the Holy-SpE1t, through whom love is she'd abroad in our hearts.';§"-Q()cflla:s not predestinated any--one-'excep"1 whom He foreknew wo-U:labeIieveand answer His'Cait"f~TfiUS his zeal for frE~e-wlilwhlch-burne(rwarlIllythroughout this whoTe--- period of his life,didn6£expenaitseTI merely m Its strong assemoff over -agalnst'the notlOilOrmvoluntary Sin,~bufwas'cair'ied over als~ into the matter of salvation.

His earlier view he speaks of as merely an unformed view. He "had not yet very carefully inquired into or sought out the nature of the election of grace of which the apostle speaks" in Rom. x. 1-5. He had not yet thought of inquiring whether faith itself is not God's gift.

[P000043] AUGUSTINE AND HIS "CO~VFESSIONS." 123 that he will not repulse the Caller."* About this clause there was much disputation a thousand years later between the Jansenists r and the Congruists. As it stands in the text it is only a chance clause, in no way expressive of Augustine's developed thought, in which undoubtedly the grace of God is conceived as creative. Indeed, immediately before it occurs the declaration that "the effect of the Divine mercy can by no means be abandoned to the powers of man, as if, unless man willed it, God would vainly have exercised His mercy," the doctrine suggested by which is scarcely wholly congruous with the notion of "congruous grace." "\Vhat the clause indicates to us is not, therefore, a determinate teaching of Augustine's, but rather the fact that he had not even yet very carefully inquired into the nature of the operation of God which he called grace, and was liable to suggest inconsistent views of its mode of operation in immediately contiguous sentences. Was it the qud or merely a sine qud non of salvation? To this question his fundamental principle of absolute dependence on God, that God alone is "our power," had a very decisive reply to give: and he was destined to find that reply and to announce it with great decision. But as yet he had not been led to think it out with precision. In important re~pects his view remained still unformed. This instance of the gradual elaboration even of Augustine's most fundamental conceptions is only one of many that could be adduced.

If Loofs says of Athanasius, for example, that he did not make the Nicrenum, but the Nicrenum made him; he is compelled to say, on the contrary, of Augustine, that he was not formed in the Pelagian controversy, but his preformation was the occasion of it. "Pelagianism," he remarks, * perhaps with some slight exaggeration, "was first of all nothing but a reaction of the old moralistic rationalism against the monergism of grace that was exalted by Augustine's type of piety." Of course, we are not to imagine that on this showing Augustine had from the first nothing to learn: or even that he ultimately worked out his fundamental principle perfectly into all the details of his teaching.

He was pleased to point out' how thIs element oeit and'tnat had found broken expression in the pages of his great predecessors. He was successful in showing that all the true religious life of the Church from the beginning had flowed in the channels determined by it.

It is the spectaCle of collectivism and individualism striving to create a modus vivendi; of dependence on God alone, and the intermediation of a human institution endeavoring to come to good understanding. It was not and is not possible for them to do so. Augustine had glimpses of the distinction between the invisible an<rt:he visible Church' afterward elaboraTed by "lJTs' splrltuarchTfdren: he touched on tlle prohlem"ralsecfby-the notIons ()f baptismal regeneration and the necessity of the intermediation of the Church for salvation in the face of his passionately held doctrine of the free grace of God, and worked out a sort of compromise between them. In one way or another he found a measure of contentment for his double mind. But this could not last.
