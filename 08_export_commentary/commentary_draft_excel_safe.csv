  V. The Parousia 1. Definition: The word denotes “coming,” “arrival.” It is never applied to the incarnation of Christ, and could be applied to His second coming only, partly because it had already become a fixed Messianic term, partly because there was a point of view from which the future appearance of Jesus appeared the sole adequate expression of His Messianic dignity and glory.

Terms like gnosis/epignosis can denote advanced understanding for the mature, yet they also describe the common knowledge of the gospel. Paul teaches with ordered method and views the gospel as objective truth requiring enlightened understanding; this unified knowledge centers on God and Christ.

  “The Pauline Conception of Redemption” The Bible Student 5:51-58.

The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere.

Paul’s sowing metaphor teaches that our inability to picture the resurrection body does not make it impossible; God gives a body as He wills, often quite unlike the seed. The passage should not be pressed to assert a material ‘germ’ in the corpse or to detail degrees of identity; what is sown is the body, which dies and is made alive. The focus is on the body, not the believer’s subjective spirit. “Sowing” can be viewed as encompassing the whole earthly life (including burial). Paul also answers the 15:35 question by pointing to the diversity of bodies God already uses (15:39–41): here ‘sarx’ means ‘body,’ and the resurrection body will differ in kind (heteros) from the present body, not merely as another of the same kind (allos).",作者指出，林前15:35所提出的问题，关切的是复活之身的“样式/性质”，而非其物质“成分”。保罗以“撒种”的比喻说明：即便我们难以想象复活之身，也不因此否定其可能性；神按自己的旨意赐下身体，常与所撒的种子大不相同。此比喻不应被硬压去回答“身体中是否有某种生命胚芽”或“物质同一性”的问题；所“撒下”的就是身体本身，它死了，又被叫活。整段讨论焦点在“身体”，而非信徒主观的灵。“撒种”可理解为涵盖整个人生（当然包括下葬）。保罗又以神所造诸身体的多样（15:39–41）回应15:35：此处“肉体”（sarx）意近“身体”，复活之身与现今之身在“种类”上有显著差异（heteros），而不只是同类中的差别（allos）。,"[""1 Cor 15:35 asks about the kind/mode of the resurrection body, not its substance."", ""The sowing metaphor shows conceptual difficulty is no proof of impossibility; God gives a body as He wills, often unlike the seed."", ""Do not over-press the metaphor for material continuity or a bodily ‘germ’; what is sown is the body, which dies and is made alive."", ""Discussion centers on the body, not the believer’s subjective spirit."", ""‘Sowing’ may encompass the whole earthly life (including burial)."", ""Diversity-of-bodies argument (15:39–41) addresses 15:35: ‘sarx’ there = ‘body’; the resurrection body differs in kind (heteros), not merely species (allos).""]","[""林前15:35问的是复活之身的“样式/性质”，不是其“物质成分”。"", ""撒种比喻强调：难以想象≠不可能；神按旨意赐下身体，常与种子大异其趣。"", ""不可把比喻硬解为说明物质同一或体内“生命胚芽”；所撒的是“身体”，身体死了又被叫活。"", ""讨论焦点在“身体”，不是信徒主观之灵。"", ""“撒种”可广义指整个人生（包括下葬）。"", ""15:39–41以身体多样性回应15:35：此处“sarx”近“身体”；复活之身在“种类”上与现今之身不同（heteros），不只是同类差别（allos）。""]",ent — https://www.biblicaltheology.org/ent.pdf,"- para_id=187, p_index=31: Directly analyzes 1 Cor 15:35 within 15:35–58: clarifies the question (kind vs substance), the sowing metaphor, focus on body not spirit, possible scope of ‘sowing,’ diversity-of-bodies argument, and allos/heteros distinction.",,,,,,,,,

Paul’s sowing metaphor does not teach material identity but answers the objection that we cannot conceive the resurrection body: God gives a different body as He wills. Some continuity is implied but not defined; the body itself is sown, dies, and is made alive—“bare grain” refers to the body, not the believer’s subjective spirit. The Spirit in view is the (objective) Spirit of Christ. “Sowing” may encompass the whole earthly life (including burial), suggested by the predicates in vv.42–43. In vv.39–41 Paul argues from the diversity of bodies God already gives (animals, heavenly/earthly, differences among heavenly bodies), focusing on kind/quality/appearance rather than substance; sarx in v.39 equals “body,” not “fleshly lusts.” The Greek contrast allos/heteros indicates the resurrection body differs in kind (heteros), not merely as another of the same kind.",本段主要讨论复活身体的“样式/类型”，而非其“本质”（直到15:50才触及本质问题）。保罗的“撒种”比喻不是强调物质同一性，而是回应“不可想象即不可能”的质疑：神照祂的旨意赐下不同的身体。经文仅暗示某种连续性，却未详细界定；所“种”的是身体本身，它死而复活——“赤露的子粒”指身体，不是信徒主观的灵；文中涉及的灵是客观的基督之灵。“撒种”可能包括整个人在世的生命（并当然包含下葬），由15:42–43的“羞辱、软弱、属血气”等用语支持。15:39–41通过受造界身体的多样性（动物、天体与地体、天体之间的差异）论证焦点在“样/性质/外观”而非“本质”；15:39的“肉”（sarx）等同“身体”，不是“情欲的肉体”。希腊文 allos/heteros 的对比表明：复活的身体在“种类”上与现今身体大为不同（heteros），不只是同类中的另一个（allos）。,"[""Paul addresses the kind of the resurrection body (vv.35–49); only in v.50 is substance broached."", ""Sowing metaphor: demonstrates divine bestowal of a different body; do not press it for material identity."", ""Continuity is implied but undefined: the body is sown, dies, and is made alive; “bare grain” = body, not the believer’s spirit; the Spirit in view is Christ’s Spirit."", ""“Sowing” may span the whole earthly life (including burial), suggested by predicates in vv.42–43."", ""Diversity argument (vv.39–41): God provides many bodily kinds (animals, heavenly/earthly, differences among heavenly bodies); focus on kind/quality/appearance, not substance; sarx in v.39 = body, not “fleshly lust.”"", ""Greek nuance: allos vs. heteros—resurrection body differs in kind (heteros), not merely another of the same kind (allos).""]","[""保罗主要处理复活身体的“样/类型”（35–49节）；到50节才触及“本质”的问题。"", ""“撒种”比喻旨在说明神按旨意赐下不同的身体，不可据此推论物质同一性。"", ""仅有连贯性的暗示但未界定：被“种下”的是身体，本身死而复活；“赤露的子粒”指身体非人的主观之灵；涉及的是基督的圣灵。"", ""“撒种”或涵盖整个人在世生命（并包括埋葬），由42–43节的用语支持。"", ""39–41节的多样性论证：神能赐下多种身体（动物、天体与地体、天体间差异）；焦点在“样/性质/外观”非“本质”；39节中 sarx=“身体”，非“情欲的肉体”。"", ""希腊文 allos 与 heteros 的区别：复活身体在“种类”上与现今身体大不相同（heteros），不是仅属同类的另一种（allos）。""]",ent — https://www.biblicaltheology.org/ent.pdf,"- para_id=187, p_index=31: Direct exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15:35–58: sowing metaphor, focus on kind vs substance, timing of sowing, diversity of bodies (vv.39–41), Greek allos/heteros, sarx vs soma, and focus on the body rather than the believer’s subjec",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vv. 45–46 Paul broadens the contrast beyond the body to two world-orders, each headed by an Adam—the first from earth (ek gēs), the second characterized as from heaven (ex ouranou). “From heaven” refers not to Christ’s preexistence or incarnation but to his eschatological state; reading it otherwise would contradict the order “not the pneumatic first, but the psychical” and would wrongly make the pneumatic constitutive of Christ pre-incarnation.
