Definition: The word denotes “coming,” “arrival.” It is never applied to the incarnation of Christ, and could be applied to His second coming only, partly because it had already become a fixed Messianic term, partly because there was a point of view from which the future appearance of Jesus appeared the sole adequate expression of His Messianic dignity and glory.

  “The Pauline Conception of Redemption” The Bible Student 5:51-58.

The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere.

1Cor 11:24,1Cor,11,24,24,,祝謝了，就擘開，說：「這是我的身體，為你們捨〔有古卷作：擘開〕的，你們應當如此行，為的是記念我。」,1,"The phrase in 1 Cor 11:24, “This is my body for you” (huper humon), signals sacrificial surrender on behalf of believers. Thus Paul understands the Supper not merely as a rite of covenant fellowship but as an atoning rite that introduces into the new covenant because it atones. Together with “the new covenant in my blood” (v.25) and Passover imagery (1 Cor 5:7), Christ’s death is presented as removing the guilt of sin (objective) and grounding believers’ purity (subjective).",林前11:24中的“这是我的身体，为你们（ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν）”表明基督为信徒所献的牺牲性舍命。因此，保罗将主餐理解为不但引入新约团契，更首先是赎罪的礼仪；正因赎罪，才引入新约。配合“这杯是用我血所立的新约”（11:25）与逾越节意象（林前5:7），基督之死既除去罪咎（客观层面），也成为信徒圣洁生活的根基（主观层面）。,"[""“For you” (huper humon) in 11:24 denotes sacrificial surrender on behalf of believers."", ""The Supper signifies an atoning rite that introduces into the covenant because it atones, not merely a fellowship rite."", ""Linked with “in my blood” (v.25) and Passover typology (1 Cor 5:7), Christ’s sacrifice removes guilt (objective) and grounds ethical purity (subjective).""]","[""11:24中的“为你们”（huper humon）表明基督的舍身具有代赎、祭献性质。"", ""主餐显明赎罪之死；它之所以引入新约团契，是因为先行赎罪，而非相反。"", ""结合“在我血中的新约”（11:25）与逾越节意象（林前5:7），基督的祭献除去罪咎（客观）并推动圣洁生活（主观）。""]",sipda — https://www.biblicaltheology.org/sipda.pdf,"- para_id=721, p_index=7: Explicitly interprets “the body…for you” (1 Cor 11:24) as sacrificial, relates it to “the new covenant in my blood” (v.25), and concludes that 1 Cor 11:24–25 teach sacrifice removes guilt.",,,,,,,,,

  next, the Lord’s death appears as a covenant sacrifice: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” Ritschl concludes from this that the death of Christ cannot have had for Paul any more definite associations than those of a transaction introducing the New Testament church into the communion of God to which the forgiveness of sin is attached. Of course, a covenant sacrifice is a sacrifice which introduces into covenant fellowship," but this general statement leaves entirely undetermined the manne …""",gpt-5,v1,2025-12-16T06:34:19-05:00,ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This shows Paul associates Christ’s blood with sacrificial propitiation, not merely with a violent death, and accords with his emphasis on Christ’s voluntary, obedient self-offering.",本文将林前11:25理解为：基督的血是立新约的“祭血”，与西奈之约用祭牲之血立约相对照；这表明保罗把基督之血与赎罪性的祭祀联系在一起，而不仅是暴力死亡的记号，也符合他强调基督自愿顺服地献上自己的死亡。,"[""In 1 Cor 11:25 the cup signifies sacrificial blood inaugurating the new covenant, paralleling the Sinai covenant’s ratification by blood."", ""Paul thereby links Christ’s blood with sacrificial propitiation rather than merely the fact of a violent death."", ""This fits Paul’s stress on Christ’s voluntary, obedient self-offering.""]","[""林前11:25中的“杯”表明基督之血是立新约的祭血，对应西奈立约时以血立约。"", ""因此，保罗把基督之血与赎罪性的祭祀相连，而非仅指暴力致死的现象。"", ""这与保罗强调基督自愿、顺服的献祭之死相一致。""]",sipda — https://www.biblicaltheology.org/sipda.pdf,"- para_id=716, p_index=2: Explicitly identifies 1 Cor 11:25 as presenting Christ’s blood as sacrificial blood inaugurating the new covenant and argues this supports a propitiatory, not merely violent-death, understanding.",,,,,,,,,

  the sacrificial idea in Paul’s mind by the scarcity of explicit sacrificial language in his writings. But the question may be raised whether the passages which contain the idea of sacrifice more or less explicitly are actually so few in number as Weiss and others would have us believe. First of all we have the classical passage, Romans 3:25, 26. Next the words quoted by the apostle from the institution of the Supper," in which the blood of Christ is represented as sacrificial blood inaugurating t …""",gpt-5,v1,2025-12-16T06:34:56-05:00,ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
