1Cor 1:8,1Cor,1,8,8,,他也必堅固你們到底，叫你們在我們主耶穌基督的日子無可責備。,1,1,https://www.biblicaltheology.org/ent.pdf,"- ent (para_id=166, p_index=10): V. The Parousia 1. Definition: The word denotes “coming,” “arrival.” It is never applied to the incarnation of Christ, and could be applied to His second coming only, partly because it had already become a fixed Messianic term, partly because there was a point of view from which the future appearance of Jesus appeared the sole adequate expression of His Messianic dignity and glory. The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

Course of Development In New Testament eschatological teaching a general development in a well-defined direction is traceable. The starting-point is the historico-dramatic conception of the two successive ages. These two ages are distinguished as houtos ho aion, ho nun aion, ho enesios aion, “this age,” “the present age” (Matthew 12:32; 13:22; Luke 16:8; Romans 12:2; 1 Corinthians 1:20; 2:6, 8; 3:18; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Galatians 1:4; Ephesians 1:21; 2:2; 6:12; 1 Timothy 6:17; 2 Timothy 4:10; Titus 2:12), and ho aion ekeinos, ho aion mellon, ho aion erchomenos, “that age,” “the future age” (Matthew 12:32; Luke 18: 30; 20:35; Ephesians 2:7; Hebrews 6:5). In Jewish literature before the New Testament, no instances of the developed antithesis between these two ages seem to be found, but f …"

An anthropomorphic description of the power of God is in the figures of “hand,” His “arm,” His “finger.” See “God.” 3. Other Modes of Expression: Some of the attributes of Yahweh have an intimate connection with His omnipotence. Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration. The representation of God as Spirit in the Old Testament does not primarily refer to the incorporealness of the divine nature, but to its inherent energy. The physical element underlying the conception of Spirit is that of air in motion, and in this at first not the invisibility but the force forms the point of comparison. The opposite of “Spirit” in this sense is “flesh,” w …"

As a psychological explanation of the conversion it appears extremely implausible. But the mere fact that such a theory could be in all seriousness proposed and worked out with a degree of verisimilitude shows how potent a force the theologizing habit must have been in Paul’s mental make-up. It is well to remember this, because at the present day, the opposite tendency, which sees in the apostle not primarily the man of the intellect, but the man of the will, the missionary, the organizer, the religious enthusiast, and explains his theology out of his experience as a Christian, has and is likely for some time to hold the upper hand. Of course this also represents an important aspect of Paul’s many-sided equipment, but carried to an extreme it i …"

Ritschl has attempted in yet a different way to relieve the harshness of the expression. He thinks Paul distinguished between the curse of the law and the curse of God, and appeals to verse 19 in proof of this distinction. But, although the law is here said to have been ordained through angels, this by no means alters the fact that God is its ultimate source.5 Besides this, the agency of the angels in the original promulgation of the law does not involve that they are also the agents for enforcing it, i.e., the originators of the curse.

The Spirit is the source of the eschatological musthrion both in the sphere of being and in the sphere of revelation. Hence also in verse 11 Paul draws a formal distinction between the pneuma of the kosmoj and the pneuma to ek tou qeou, which once more shows that the Spirit is considered not exclusively as a principium revelationis, but as the determining principle of an order of things, and therefore as the natural organ for disclosing its content.49 The passage also furnishes a parallel to the eschatological interpretation of the contrast between yucikoj and pneumatikoj met with i …

Here both the conception of doxa as the content of the gospel and the parallelism between the first and the second creation in verse 6 impart an unmistakable eschatological flavor to the comparison. Where the thought of the wisdom-passage in 1 Corinthians 2 recurs later in Colossians 2:2ff. with many striking reminiscences even as to form, the contrast becomes one purely between Christ and the spirits, and the conception of the pneuma tou kosmou in its opposition to the pneuma to ek tou qeou does not reappear. …"

The Holy Spirit marks them as God’s property, which he will reclaim at the end. It is not possible to determine whether in the instances quoted the apostle, besides implying the notion of “recovery,” also means to imply the further thought that this recovery rests on the legal basis of the payment of a ransom price. In the other passages, however, the context shows that this latter thought was not only in his mind, but formed the center of the conception. The only question is to what extent he means to press the comparison from this point of view. To say that Christians have been delivered for a price may express no more than that thei …"

This is transferred in the New Testament to the parousia of Christ.

Of course, a covenant sacrifice is a sacrifice which introduces into covenant fellowship, but this general statement leaves entirely undetermined the manner in which such introduction is effected.

The distinction in Judaism rested on a consciousness of difference in quality between the two stages, the content of the Messianic age being far less spiritually and transcendentally conceived than that of the final state. The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present. In some cases this assumes explicit shape in the belief that great eschatological transactions have already begun to take place, and that believers have already attained to at least pa …

Other Modes of Expression: Some of the attributes of Yahweh have an intimate connection with His omnipotence. Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration. The representation of God as Spirit in the Old Testament does not primarily refer to the incorporealness of the divine nature, but to its inherent energy.

It appears, therefore, that Paul’s thought was dwelling here upon the efficacy of the Savior’s death which extends to believers only. But believers are, according to Paul, involved in the sin and guilt of the race, and consequently the reconciliation which disposes of their sin and guilt must from the nature of the case bear also a racial, cosmical aspect.

In the New Testament the correct form is Gee’nna with the accent on the penult, not Ge’enna. There is no reason to assume that Hinnom is other than a plain patronymic, although it has been proposed to find in it the corruption of the name of an idol (EB, II:2071).

The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16.

As the resurrection of Jesus anticipates and secures the general resurrection, so the death of Christ, usually represented by Paul as an atonement, occasionally appears as securing and embodying in advance the judgment and destruction of the spiritual powers opposed to God, thus bringing the other great eschatological transaction within the scope of the present activity of Christ and the present experience of believers (Rom. 8:3, 1 Cor. 2:6, where notice the present participle katargoumenwn: “who are already co …

First, 2 Corinthians 5:5 is one of the three directly eschatological passages where, as we have seen, the present Spirit is an anticipation of the future Spirit. Secondly, the close association of the ethico-religious function of the Spirit with life in itself creates a presumption in favor of the view that the future here, in part at least, colors the present.

The idea in substance is also found in Isaiah 51:16; Matthew 19:28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 12:26-28.

The main obstacle to a proper understanding of the truth embodied in this term lies in the inadequacy of the English rendering. In common parlance, the statement that one person reconciles another is most naturally taken to mean that the former changes the subjective frame of mind of the latter, so as to render his disposition from an unfriendly to a friendly one.

Hence it is described in sacrificial terms not only, but in such sacrificial terms as strongly bring out this its character as something in which God takes delight; prosfora is placed before qusia (cf. for the usual sequence Heb. 10:5), and the phrase “for an odor of a sweet smell” is added, a phrase used by the law in connection with the whole burnt offering, in whose ritual the element of consecration was made prominent.

The Parousia 1. Definition: The word denotes “coming,” “arrival.” It is never applied to the incarnation of Christ, and could be applied to His second coming only, partly because it had already become a fixed Messianic term, partly because there was a point of view from which the future appearance of Jesus appeared the sole adequate expression of His Messianic dignity and glory. The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

Walter, Der religiöse Gehalt des Galaterbriefs, 1904, pp. 122-144, has, in our opinion, convincingly shown that the usage of en Cristw considerably overlaps the limits within which en pneumati would be applicable. It has a large forensic connotation. But where en Cristw relates to the mystical sphere, the two formulas are practically interchangeable. 41 A point of contact for it has been found in Acts 4:2.

- ent (para_id=180, p_index=24): 1. Its Universality: The New Testament teaches in some passages with sufficient clearness that all the dead will be raised, but the emphasis rests to such an extent on the soteriological aspect of the event, especially in Paul, where it is closely connected with the doctrine of the Spirit, that its reference to non-believers receives little notice. This was already partly so in the Old Testament (Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2). In the intervening Jewish literature the doctrine varies; sometimes a resurrection of the martyrs alone is taught (Enoch 90); sometimes of all the righteous dead of Israel (Psalms of Solomon 3:10; Enoch 91-94); sometimes of all the righteous and of some wicked Israelites (Enoch 1-36); sometimes of all the righteous and all the wicked (Ezra 4; 2 Esdras 5:45; 7:32).

- ent (para_id=184, p_index=28): 3. The Resurrection of Believers: The resurrection of believers bears a twofold aspect. On the one hand it belongs to the forensic side of salvation. On the other hand it belongs to the pneumatic transforming side of the saving process. Of the former, traces appear only in the teaching of Jesus (Matthew 5:9; 22:29-32; Luke 20: 35, 36). Paul clearly ascribes to the believer’s resurrection a somewhat similar forensic significance as to that of Christ (Romans 8:10, 23; 1 Corinthians 15:30-32, 55-58). Far more prominent with him is, however, the other, the pneumatic interpretation. Both the origin of the resurrection life and the continuance of the resurrection state are dependent on the Spirit (Romans 8, 10, 11; 1 Corinthians 15:45-49; Galatians 6:8).

To the foregoing may be added a rapid survey of the usage of swzein and swthria in the remainder of the NT. “Salvation” in connection with healing, but at the same time projected into the specific religious sphere, reappears in Acts 4:9, 12, 14:9. That the idea in the Apostolic teaching largely revolves around the contrast between life and death, is made abundantly plain by the following passages: Acts 3:15, 5:30, 13:46, 47, Rom. 1:16, 17, 1 Cor. 5:5, 2 Cor. 2:15, 16, 7:10, Phil. 3:20, 2 Tim. 1:10, Titus 3:5, Heb. 5:7, James 5:15, 20, 1 Pet. 3:20, 21.

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47). That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

The Judgment The judgment takes place on a “day” (Matthew 7:22; 10:15; 24:36; Luke 10:12; 21:34; 1 Corinthians 1:8; 3:13; 2 Timothy 4:8; Revelation 6:17), but this rests on the Old Testament conception of “the day of Yahweh,” and is not to be taken literally, whence also “hour” interchanges with “day” (Mark 13: 32; Revelation 14:7). While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

One who framed the comprehensive formula, “From him and through him and unto him are all things,” obviously derived the inspiration of his theology from his religion. Romans 1: 18-20 shows that all “truth” is ultimately truth concerning God. To find God everywhere of necessity leads to conceiving of all religious knowledge as organically one. This is the only standpoint which satisfactorily upholds the ideal value of theology and permanently sustains the theological impulse. Where it is not accepted, theology is apt to become even in the eyes of its friends a mere instrument for the salvation of man. At the same time the reference of all religious knowledge to God as its object of necessity imparts to the apostle’s theology an eminently practical purpose. Paul stands at the fu …"

The principle of His active obedience is here actually enunciated, although this active obedience as here defined does not quite cover the range of the active obedience of the Mediator as defined in our dogmatic theology. It refers specifically to the ceremonial law as such, whence the positive counterpart of the slavery abolished is sonship rather than life.7 The objection has been brought to the view here taken, that Christ’s obedience to the ceremonial law did not begin with His birth. This objection lacks force for two reasons: (1) Paul could conceive of the birth of Christ as the natural introduction into the life of obedience; in virtue of His Jewish birth He was under the law, i.e., obliged to fulfill it as soon as He became capable of doing so.

Compare Dalman, Die Worte Jesu, 1:132-146. Broadly speaking, the development of New Testament eschatology consists in this, that the two ages are increasingly recognized as answering to two spheres of being which coexist from of old, so that the coming of the new age assumes the character of a revelation and extension of the supernal order of things, rather than that of its first entrance into existence. Inasmuch as the coming world stood for the perfect and eternal, and in the realm of heaven s …"

- pcrec (para_id=516, p_index=3): and our being “justified” stood the “Christ died for us” (vs. 8), so between the two states of our being “enemies” and our being “reconciled” stands “we were reconciled through the death of his Son.” The objective reconciliation took place in the death of Christ; its subjective result is justification. It is incorrect to say with Cremer that “being reconciled” in verse 10 means more than “being justified” in verse 9, and far worse to seek this plus in a subjective change of heart. The two are entirely equivalent. The only progress of thought lies in this, that the contrast between the death and life of Christ is introduced in the tenth verse as strengthening the assurance of final salvation.

But the question may be raised whether the passages which contain the idea of sacrifice more or less explicitly are actually so few in number as Weiss and others would have us believe. First of all we have the classical passage, Romans 3:25, 26. Next the words quoted by the apostle from the institution of the Supper, in which the blood of Christ is represented as sacrificial blood inaugurating the new covenant, in contrast with the blood of sacrifice sprinkled by Moses on the altar and people on the occasion of ratifying the Sinaitic covenant (1 Cor. 11:25).

The main obstacle to a proper understanding of the truth embodied in this term lies in the inadequacy of the English rendering. In common parlance, the statement that one person reconciles another is most naturally taken to mean that the former changes the subjective frame of mind of the latter, so as to render his disposition from an unfriendly to a friendly one.

In Romans 8:19 what will happen at the end to believers is called a “revealing of the sons of God,” not because their new body existed previously, but because their status as sons of God existed before, and this status will be revealed through the bestowal upon them of the glorious body. Colossians 3:3 speaks of a “life . . . hid with Christ in God,” and of the “manifestation” of believers with Christ in glory at the parousia, but “life” does not imply bodily existence, and while the “manifestation” at the parousia presupposes the body, it does not imply that this body must have been acquired long before, as is the case with Christ’s body. In conclusion it should be noted that there is ample evidence in the later epistles that Paul continued to e …"

The glory into which believers are transformed through the beholding (or reflecting) of the glory of Christ as in a mirror is not a bodily but inward glory, produced by illumination of the gospel. And the manifestation of the life of Jesus in the body or in the mortal flesh refers to the preservation of bodily life in the midst of deadly perils. Equally without support is the view that at one time Paul placed the investiture with the new body immediately after death. It has been assumed that this, together with t …"

[1902] In a previous number of The Bible Student we examined the Pauline conception of reconciliation, which we found to belong to the military sphere, its result being conceived by the apostle as peace. The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere. Of course, underneath both lies the more fundamental forensic mode of viewing the work of Christ, which corresponds to the Pauline idea of righteousness. It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work. We must remember that in the ancient world reduction to slavery as a consequence of guilt or debt was quite common. The terms which Paul uses t …

The principle of His active obedience is here actually enunciated, although this active obedience as here defined does not quite cover the range of the active obedience of the Mediator as defined in our dogmatic theology. It refers specifically to the ceremonial law as such, whence the positive counterpart of the slavery abolished is sonship rather than life.7 The objection has been brought to the view here taken, that Christ’s obedience to the ceremonial law did not begin with His birth. This objection lacks force for two reasons: (1) Paul could conceive of the birth of Christ as the natural introduction into the life of obedience; in virtue of His Jewish birth He was under the law, i.e., obliged to fulfill it as soon as He became capable of doing so.

First of all we have the classical passage, Romans 3:25, 26. Next the words quoted by the apostle from the institution of the Supper, in which the blood of Christ is represented as sacrificial blood inaugurating the new covenant, in contrast with the blood of sacrifice sprinkled by Moses on the altar and people on the occasion of ratifying the Sinaitic covenant (1 Cor. 11:25).

It is well to remember this, because at the present day, the opposite tendency, which sees in the apostle not primarily the man of the intellect, but the man of the will, the missionary, the organizer, the religious enthusiast, and explains his theology out of his experience as a Christian, has and is likely for some time to hold the upper hand.

But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

Because believers live by the Spirit, they can be exhorted also to walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:25).

Of course, a covenant sacrifice is a sacrifice which introduces into covenant fellowship, but this general statement leaves entirely undetermined the manner in which such introduction is effected. Now it is said that the body of Christ is uper umwn, and elsewhere this uper stands to express the sacrificial surrender of Christ on behalf of believers. Consequently Paul must have conceived of it as a rite of atonement, as well as a rite of introduction t …

This act was the highest manifestation of His love towards us and is therefore held up as an example for the imitation of believers in their conduct towards one another. A further motive, however, for urging its imitation is derived from the fact that this act of Christ was supremely pleasing to God. Hence it is described in sacrificial terms not only, but in such sacrificial terms as strongly bring out this its character as something in which God takes delight; prosfora is placed before qusia (cf. for the usual sequence Heb. 10:5), and the phrase “for an odor of a sweet smell” is added, a phrase used by the law in connection with the whole burnt offering, in whose ritual the element of consecration was made prominent.

[1902] In a previous number of The Bible Student we examined the Pauline conception of reconciliation, which we found to belong to the military sphere, its result being conceived by the apostle as peace. The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere. Of course, underneath both lies the more fundamental forensic mode of viewing the work of Christ, which corresponds to the Pauline idea of righteousness. It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work. We must remember that in the ancient world reduction to slavery as a consequence of guilt or debt was quite common. The terms which Paul uses t …

The Holy Spirit marks them as God’s property, which he will reclaim at the end. It is not possible to determine whether in the instances quoted the apostle, besides implying the notion of “recovery,” also means to imply the further thought that this recovery rests on the legal basis of the payment of a ransom price. In the other passages, however, the context shows that this latter thought was not only in his mind, but formed the center of the conception. The only question is to what extent he means to press the comparison from this point of view. To say that Christians have been delivered for a price may express no more than that thei …

He thinks Paul distinguished between the curse of the law and the curse of God, and appeals to verse 19 in proof of this distinction. But, although the law is here said to have been ordained through angels, this by no means alters the fact that God is its ultimate source.5 Besides this, the agency of the angels in the original promulgation of the law does not involve that they are also the agents for enforcing it, i.e., the originators of the curse.

According to Weiss the references to this representation are, at least in the four great epistles, purely incidental, whilst in the other epistles Ephesians 5:2 is the only passage in which the death of Christ is directly viewed as a sacrifice. Pfleiderer also denies that the idea of sacrifice to any appreciable extent determined Paul’s doctrinal thinking on the subject.

Gal 3:23-4,Gal,3,23,4,"Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",你們受苦如此之多，都是徒然的嗎？難道果真是徒然的嗎？ 那賜給你們聖靈，又在你們中間行異能的，是因你們行律法呢？是因你們聽信福音呢？ 正如「亞伯拉罕信神，這就算為他的義」。 所以，你們要知道：那以信為本的人，就是亞伯拉罕的子孫。 並且聖經既然預先看明，神要叫外邦人因信稱義，就早已傳福音給亞伯拉罕，說：「萬國都必因你得福。」 可見那以信為本的人和有信心的亞伯拉罕一同得福。 凡以行律法為本的，都是被咒詛的；因為經上記着：「凡不常照律法書上所記一切之事去行的，就被咒詛。」 沒有一個人靠着律法在神面前稱義，這是明顯的；因為經上說，「義人必因信得生。」 律法原不本乎信，只說：「行這些事的，就必因此活着。」 基督既為我們受〔原文作成〕了咒詛，就贖出我們脫離律法的咒詛；因為經上記着：「凡掛在木頭上都是被咒詛的。」 這便叫亞伯拉罕的福，因基督耶穌可以臨到外邦人，使我們因信得着所應許的聖靈。 弟兄們，我且照着人的常話說：雖然是人的文約，若已經立定了，就沒有能廢棄或加增的。 所應許的原是向亞伯拉罕和他子孫說的。神並不是說「眾子孫」，指着許多人，乃是說「你那一個子孫」，指着一個人，就是基督。 我是這麼說，神預先所立的約，不能被那四百三十年以後的律法廢掉，叫應許歸於虛空。 因為承受產業，若本乎律法，就不本乎應許；但神是憑着應許把產業賜給亞伯拉罕。 這樣說來，律法是為甚麼有的呢？原是為過犯添上的，等候那蒙應許的子孫來到，並且是藉天使經中保之手設立的。 但中保本不是為一面作的；神卻是一位。 這樣，律法是與神的應許反對嗎？斷乎不是！若曾傳一個能叫人得生的律法，義就誠然本乎律法了。 但聖經把眾人都圈在罪裏，使所應許的福因信耶穌基督，歸給那信的人。 但這因信得救的理還未來以先，我們被看守在律法之下，直圈到那將來的真道顯明出來。,1,1,https://ia801301.us.archive.org/0/items/InterpretingTheBible/InterpretingTheBible--Revision2.pdf,"- InterpretingTheBible--Revision2 (para_id=275, p_index=54): a.

And this is verified by observing how Paul combines with righteousness the peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, and finds in this Spirit-fed peace and joy the essence of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17); how the first-fruit of the Spirit looks forward to the eschatological uioqesia (Rom. 8:23); how the katallagh and the resulting justificat …

In Romans 8:11 it is affirmed that God, dia tou enotoj autou pneumatoj (or to enoikoun autou pneuma) en umin, shall give life to their mortal bodies. In verse 10 the body and the Spirit are contrasted: the former is dead on account of sin, the latter is life on account of righteousness. Still, pneuma is here not the human spirit, psychologically conceived; it is the divine Pneuma in its close i …

On the other hand it belongs to the pneumatic transforming side of the saving process. Of the former, traces appear only in the teaching of Jesus (Matthew 5:9; 22:29-32; Luke 20: 35, 36). Paul clearly ascribes to the believer’s resurrection a somewhat similar forensic significance as to that of Christ (Romans 8:10, 23; 1 Corinthians 15:30-32, 55-58). Far more prominent with him is, however, the other, the pneumatic interpretation.

Against exclusive insistence upon the former construction we would urge the following. First, 2 Corinthians 5:5 is one of the three directly eschatological passages where, as we have seen, the present Spirit is an anticipation of the future Spirit. Secondly, the close association of the ethico-religious function of the Spirit with life in itself creates a presumption in favor of the view that the future here, in part at least, colors the present. For “life” is undoubtedly with Paul, and before Paul with Jesus, especially in the Synoptical teaching, an idea that is in the first instance eschatologically conceived and thence carried back into the present.

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia.

The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47). That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11).

The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament.

The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament. There is this difference, that in the New Testament (already in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books) the conception is chiefly used with reference to the righteous dead, and has associated with it the thought of their blessed awaking in t …

The idea in substance is also found in Isaiah 51:16; Matthew 19:28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 12:26-28.

It is also found frequently in the Septuagint, especially in the rendering of the divine names Yahweh tsebha’oth and ‘El Shaddai.

A Purified Universe 1. Eschatological Idea: The formal conception of new heavens and a new earth occurs in Isaiah 65:17, 66:22; 2 Peter 3: 13; Revelation 21:1 (where “heaven,” singular). The idea in substance is also found in Isaiah 51:16; Matthew 19:28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 12:26-28. In each case the reference is eschatological, indeed the adjective “new” seems to have acquired in this and other connections a semi-technical eschatological sense. It must be remembered that the Old Testament has no single word for “universe,” and that the phrase “heaven and earth” serves to supply the deficiency. The promise of a new heavens and a new earth is therefore equivalent to a promise of world renewal. 2. Earliest Conceptions: Cosmic verses National Type: It is a debated que …
- hnen (para_id=219, p_index=5): show that often even prophecies belonging to the latter type embody material and employ means of expression which presuppose acquaintance with the idea of a world-catastrophe at the end. On this view the world-eschatology would have, from ancient times, existed alongside of the more narrowly confined outlook, and would be even older than the latter. These writers further assume that the cosmic eschatology was not indigenous among the Hebrews, but of oriental (Babylonian) origin, a theory which they apply not only to the more developed system of the later apocalyptic writings, but also to its preformations in the Old Testament. The cosmic eschatology is not believed to have been the distinctive property of the great ethical prophets, but rather a commonly current mythological belief to whic …"

The conception is based on prophecies which predict a glorious future to Jerusalem after the judgment (Isaiah 52:1). In Revelation, however, it is not descriptive of any actual locality on earth, but allegorically depicts the final state of the church (“the bride,” “the wife of the Lamb,” Revelation 21:2, 9), when the new heaven and the new earth shall have come into being. The picture is drawn from a twofold point of view: the new Jerusalem is a restoration of Paradise (Revelation 21:6, 22:1, 2, 14); it is also the ideal of theocracy realized (Revelation 21:3, 12, 14, 22).

The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere. Of course, underneath both lies the more fundamental forensic mode of viewing the work of Christ, which corresponds to the Pauline idea of righteousness. It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work. We must remember that in the ancient world reduction to slavery as a consequence of guilt or debt was quite common. The terms which Paul uses t …"

A Purified Universe 1. Eschatological Idea: The formal conception of new heavens and a new earth occurs in Isaiah 65:17, 66:22; 2 Peter 3: 13; Revelation 21:1 (where “heaven,” singular). The idea in substance is also found in Isaiah 51:16; Matthew 19:28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 12:26-28. In each case the reference is eschatological, indeed the adjective “new” seems to have acquired in this and other connections a semi-technical eschatological sense. It must be remembered that the Old Testament has no single word for “universe,” and that the phrase “heaven and earth” serves to supply the deficiency. The promise of a new heavens and a new earth is therefore equivalent to a promise of world renewal. 2. Earliest Conceptions: Cosmic verses National Type: It is a debated que …

On this view the world-eschatology would have, from ancient times, existed alongside of the more narrowly confined outlook, and would be even older than the latter. These writers further assume that the cosmic eschatology was not indigenous among the Hebrews, but of oriental (Babylonian) origin, a theory which they apply not only to the more developed system of the later apocalyptic writings, but also to its preformations in the Old Testament. The cosmic eschatology is not believed to have been the distinctive property of the great ethical prophets, but rather a commonly current mythological belief to whic …

In the same manner a difference in the degree or mode of punishment between the intermediate state and the age to come is plainly taught. For on the one hand the eternal punishment is related to persons in the body (Matthew 10:28), and on the other hand it is assigned to a distinct place, Gehenna, which is never named in connection with the torment of the intermediate state.

The distinction in Judaism rested on a consciousness of difference in quality between the two stages, the content of the Messianic age being far less spiritually and transcendentally conceived than that of the final state. The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present. In some cases this assumes explicit shape in the belief that great eschatological transactions have already begun to take place, and that believers have already attained to at least pa …"

The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

Yet this promise has been entirely fulfilled in Christ and in the other prophets in their connection with him, because they were all servants and types of Christ, through whom he spoke to the people. Greijdanus also gives the example of Matthew 2:17-18. This passage speaks of the murder of Bethlehem's children as a fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy (Jeremiah 31:15). However, this does not deny that this prophecy was also fulfilled already in a certain measure in the captivity of Judah in Babylon. But the m …"

Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration. The representation of God as Spirit in the Old Testament does not primarily refer to the incorporealness of the divine nature, but to its inherent energy. The physical element underlying the conception of Spirit is that of air in motion, and in this at first not the invisibility but the force forms the point of comparison.

There is no accident (1 Samuel 6:9; compare with 1 Samuel 6: 12; Proverbs 16:33). It need not operate through second causes; it itself underlies all second causes and makes them what they are.

Nor is the intermediate operation of the Spirit in the present meant to preclude His eternal significance as a factor in the life to come. That the latter idea is not more pointedly brought out in John is due to the thoroughgoing manner in which the fourth Gospel eternalizes the present state of the believer and emphasizes the identity rather than the difference between the life now possessed and the life to be inherited hereafter. Viewed in this light of the prominence of the Spirit’s activity now not only does not tell against, but distinctly favors the assumption that the Spirit has His proper sphere and a dominating part in the eschatological world. But, even if the facts were different as regards the fourth …"

A careful examination, however, shows that this is nowhere intended. Thus in the wellknown passage of Romans (5:12-21), where a parallel is drawn between the first and second Adam and the spread of sin and righteousness in the world through the transgression of the one and the obedience of the other, Paul speaks of the operation not merely of the former principle, but also of the latter as extending to all.

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy. It cannot be a priori denied that this peculiarity of prophetic vision may have here characterized also the outlook of Jesus into the future which, as Mark 13:32 shows, was the prophetic outlook of His human nature as distinct from the Divine omniscience. The possibility of misinterpreting this feature and confounding sequence in perspective with chronological succession is in th …"

The fourth Gospel insofar agrees with this, that it shows Jesus at the beginning of His ministry introducing the subject of the kingdom to Nicodemus (John 3:3). But, while in the synoptists the kingdom remains the central theme to which all the other elements in our Lord’s teaching are more or less distinctly related, in the Johannine discourses we hear no more of it after this one reference.

Eschatological is also the reference in the question of the disciples recorded in Matt. 19:25, Mark 10: 26, Luke 18:26 “Then who can be saved?” The question was called forth by Jesus’ declaration, that the rich would with great difficulty enter into the Kingdom of God, which was in turn called forth by the question of the rich young man, “What shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?” Here “to be saved” = “to enter the Kingdom” = “to inherit eternal life” and the qualification of life as eternal, as well as the further context – St. Peter’s question about future rewards, and our Lord’s answer to this – prove that the whole discussion is eschatologi …
- salvation (para_id=687, p_index=7): According to John 3:16, 17, “to have eternal life” and “to be saved” are synonymous.

Again, in 10:9, 10 “salvation” and “life” appear in close conjunction; 12:47 receives its interpretation from 3:17. The same difference as is observable with reference to eschatological salvation may be observed where present salvation is spoken of. Sometimes the conception is negative (Matt. 1:21, Luke 7:50), sometimes positive as well as negative (Luke 19:10); the salvation which came to Zacchaeus’ house certainly included more than pardon, since it issued in renewal of life. The facts, therefore, do not bear out the contention of B. Weiss, who maintains …

On the basis of our present Gospels, apart from critical reconstructions of the teaching of Jesus, no other view is possible than that our Lord represented salvation as in some way bound to and wrapped up in His Person. He did not represent salvation as something unconditioned, flowing simply from the love of God, which would overleap every necessity of mediation. The parable of the Prodigal Son, so often quoted to the contrary, furnishes, when rightly read, the clearest demonstration of this, for it was spoken to describe not God’s attitude toward sinners in the abstract, but the historic approach of God to lost men in the appearance of His Son Jesus. …"

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47).

The Resurrection of Believers: The resurrection of believers bears a twofold aspect. On the one hand it belongs to the forensic side of salvation. On the other hand it belongs to the pneumatic transforming side of the saving process. Of the former, traces appear only in the teaching of Jesus (Matthew 5:9; 22:29-32; Luke 20: 35, 36). Paul clearly ascribes to the believer’s resurrection a somewhat similar forensic significance as to that of Christ (Romans 8:10, 23; 1 Corinthians 15:30-32, 55-58). Far more prominent with him is, however, the other, the pneumatic interpretation. Both the origin of the resurrection life and the continuance of the resurrection state are dependent on the Spirit (Romans 8, 10, 11; 1 Corinthians 15:45-49; Galatians 6:8). The resurrection is the climax of the bel …"

But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11).

Only two groups are recognized, those of the condemned and of the saved (Matthew 25:33, 14; John 5:29); no intermediate group with as yet undetermined destiny anywhere appears. The degree of guilt is fixed according to the knowledge of the Divine will possessed in life (Matthew 10:15; 11:20-24; Luke 10:12-15; 12:47, 48; John 15:22, 24; Romans 2:12; 2 Peter 2:20-22).

Again, in 10:9, 10 “salvation” and “life” appear in close conjunction; 12:47 receives its interpretation from 3:17. The same difference as is observable with reference to eschatological salvation may be observed where present salvation is spoken of. Sometimes the conception is negative (Matt. 1:21, Luke 7:50), sometimes positive as well as negative (Luke 19:10); the salvation which came to Zacchaeus’ house certainly included more than pardon, since it issued in renewal of life.

The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present.

John 11:25,John,11,25,25,"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:",耶穌對她說：「復活在我，生命也在我。信我的人雖然死了，也必復活，,1,1,https://www.biblicaltheology.org/ent.pdf,"- ent (para_id=196, p_index=40): X. The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament. There is this difference, that in the New Testament (already in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books) the conception is chiefly used with reference to the righteous dead, and has associated with it the thought of their blessed awaking in t …"

With reference to this the two senses of the verb, “to be missing” and “to be destroyed,” are used side by side. From the point of view of man the judgment may bring a “losing” or a “finding,” “keeping” of the soul or life (Matt. 10:39, 16:25, Mark 8:35, Luke 9:24, 25, 17:33, John 12:25).

And in the Fourth Gospel we are explicitly told that the physical acts are intended to point to corresponding spiritual transactions; the healing of the blind, the raising of the dead, are symbolic of Jesus’ saving work in the spiritual sphere (5:14, 19-29, 9:3, 39, 12:25, 26). On three occasions our Lord has brought out the spiritual significance of the physical salvation by calling special attention to its dependence on the exercise of faith: the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:34 = Matt. 9:22 = Luke 8:48), the blind man near Jericho (Mark 10:52 = Luke 18:42), one of the lepers (Luke 17:19).

Eita can be used just as well as tote to denote momentary sequence of action, as will be seen from a comparison of vss. 5, 6, 7 in this same chapter, John 13:4, 5, 19:26, 27. Of course a brief interval, in logical conception at least, must be assumed; to teloj comes, strictly speaking, after the rising of oi tou Cristou. The absolute phrase to teloj does not favor the view that “the end of the resurrection” is meant by it. In its absoluteness the simple to teloj is too weighty for this: it must have a more comprehensive meaning. To interpret it of the end of the present aeon is scarcely admissible, for that coincides with the Parousia and by means of eita “the end” is represented as a step subsequent to th …"

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy.

But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11).

The distinction in Judaism rested on a consciousness of difference in quality between the two stages, the content of the Messianic age being far less spiritually and transcendentally conceived than that of the final state. The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present.

There is no accident (1 Samuel 6:9; compare with 1 Samuel 6: 12; Proverbs 16:33). It need not operate through second causes; it itself underlies all second causes and makes them what they are. It is creative power producing its effect through a mere word (Genesis 1:3; Deuteronomy 8:3; Psalm 33:9; Romans 4:17; Hebrews 1:3, 11:30). Among the prophets, especially Isaiah …"

It is kingdom against kingdom, but both of these opposing powers belong to a higher world than that to which Rome and her empire belong. One of the clearest sayings, in which our Lord speaks of the kingdom as real and present, describes it as consisting in the power which overcomes Satan: “If I by the Spirit of God (the finger of God) cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God come upon you.” In the dislodgment of Satan the kingdom of God comes, exerts its …

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47). That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

- salvation (para_id=688, p_index=8): His Messianic dignity, but rather allowing it to be gradually inferred from the impression made by His Person and the witness of His works. On the basis of our present Gospels, apart from critical reconstructions of the teaching of Jesus, no other view is possible than that our Lord represented salvation as in some way bound to and wrapped up in His Person. He did not represent salvation as something unconditioned, flowing simply from the love of God, which would overleap every necessity of mediation. The parable of the Prodigal Son, so often quoted to the contrary, furnishes, when rightly read, the clearest demonstration of this, for it was spoken to describe not God’s attitude toward sinners in the abstract, but the historic approach of God to lost men in the appearance of His Son Jesus. …"

In the same manner a difference in the degree or mode of punishment between the intermediate state and the age to come is plainly taught. For on the one hand the eternal punishment is related to persons in the body (Matthew 10:28), and on the other hand it is assigned to a distinct place, Gehenna, which is never named in connection with the torment of the intermediate state.

To the foregoing may be added a rapid survey of the usage of swzein and swthria in the remainder of the NT. “Salvation” in connection with healing, but at the same time projected into the specific religious sphere, reappears in Acts 4:9, 12, 14:9. That the idea in the Apostolic teaching largely revolves around the contrast between life and death, is made abundantly plain by the following passages: Acts 3:15, 5:30, 13:46, 47, Rom. 1:16, 17, 1 Cor. 5:5, 2 Cor. 2:15, 16, 7:10, Phil. 3:20, 2 Tim. 1:10, Titus 3:5, Heb. 5:7, James 5:15, 20, 1 Pet. 3:20, 21. Where the saving act is referred to a definite point of time, this is most frequently the eschatological future (Rom. 13:11, 1 Cor. 3:15, 5: 5, Phil. 1:28, 1 Thess. 5:8, 2 Thess. 2:13, Heb. 1:14, 2:10, 9:28, James 5:20, 1 Pet. …"

In each of these cases it denotes the final state of ruin and punishment which forms the opposite to salvation. The verb apolluein, from which the word is derived, has two meanings: (1) to lose; (2) to destroy. Both of these pass over to the noun, so that apoleia comes to signify: (1) loss; (2) ruin, destruction. The former occurs in Matthew 26:8; Mark 14:4, the latter in the passages cited above.

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy.

The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

Only two groups are recognized, those of the condemned and of the saved (Matthew 25:33, 14; John 5:29); no intermediate group with as yet undetermined destiny anywhere appears. The degree of guilt is fixed according to the knowledge of the Divine will possessed in life (Matthew 10:15; 11:20-24; Luke 10:12-15; 12:47, 48; John 15:22, 24; Romans 2:12; 2 Peter 2:20-22).

In the former utterance it is predicted of Capernaum that it shall in punishment for its unbelief “go down unto Hades.” As in the Old Testament Sheol is a figure for the greatest depths known (Deuteronomy 32:22; Isaiah 7:11, 57:9; Job 11:8, 26:6), this seems to be a figure for the extreme of humiliation to which that city was to be reduced in the course of history.

The question is not, of course, whether the element of “healing” as a connotated idea should be entirely eliminated from swzein. Not only would this have been impossible to a Greek speaker or writer in cases where the saving act as a matter of fact consisted in or involved healing, but it is also excluded by the observation that Jesus more than once referred to His saving work as the work of a physician, and in the instruction to His disciples spoke also of it as “healing” (Matt. 9:12, 10:1, 8, 13:15, Mark 2:17, Luke 4:18, 5:31, 9:1, 2, 10:9).

In the same manner a difference in the degree or mode of punishment between the intermediate state and the age to come is plainly taught. For on the one hand the eternal punishment is related to persons in the body (Matthew 10:28), and on the other hand it is assigned to a distinct place, Gehenna, which is never named in connection with the torment of the intermediate state.

In the New Testament the correct form is Gee’nna with the accent on the penult, not Ge’enna. There is no reason to assume that Hinnom is other than a plain patronymic, although it has been proposed to find in it the corruption of the name of an idol (EB, II:2071).

This was already partly so in the Old Testament (Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2).

The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

On the basis of our present Gospels, apart from critical reconstructions of the teaching of Jesus, no other view is possible than that our Lord represented salvation as in some way bound to and wrapped up in His Person. He did not represent salvation as something unconditioned, flowing simply from the love of God, which would overleap every necessity of mediation. The parable of the Prodigal Son, so often quoted to the contrary, furnishes, when rightly read, the clearest demonstration of this, for it was spoken to describe not God’s attitude toward sinners in the abstract, but the historic approach of God to lost men in the appearance of His Son Jesus. …"

Other Modes of Expression: Some of the attributes of Yahweh have an intimate connection with His omnipotence. Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration. The representation of God as Spirit in the Old Testament does not primarily refer to the incorporealness of the divine nature, but to its inherent energy. The physical element underlying the conception of Spirit is that of air in motion, and in this at first not the invisibility but the force forms the point of comparison.

Besides, the pneumatic character of the resurrection is clearly implied in chapter 4:14, for if the death and resurrection of Jesus jointly considered furnish the guarantee of the believer’s resurrection, this must be understood on the principle that in Christ’s experience that of the Christian is prefigured.

It is easy to see how on either view a significant connection could be established between the Messiah and the covenant. The LXX regularly renders berith by diaqhkh, the later Greek versions prefer sunqhkh. The latter term better expresses the idea of a two-sided agreement; but probably this was precisely the reason why the LXX translators, desiring to emphasize the one-sided Divine origin and character of the covenant, avoided it. It should also be remembered that in not a few instances berith in the original meant not a covenant but an authoritative disposition, which, as stated above, is according to some scholars even the primary meaning of the word. On the side of the Greek, also, there were …"

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47). That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy. It cannot be a priori denied that this peculiarity of prophetic vision may have here characterized also the outlook of Jesus into the future which, as Mark 13:32 shows, was the prophetic outlook of His human nature as distinct from the Divine omniscience. The possibility of misinterpreting this feature and confounding sequence in perspective with chronological succession is in th …"

The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament. There is this difference, that in the New Testament (already in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books) the conception is chiefly used with reference to the righteous dead, and has associated with it the thought of their blessed awaking in t …"

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia.

On three occasions our Lord has brought out the spiritual significance of the physical salvation by calling special attention to its dependence on the exercise of faith: the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:34 = Matt. 9:22 = Luke 8:48), the blind man near Jericho (Mark 10:52 = Luke 18:42), one of the lepers (Luke 17:19).

And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy. It cannot be a priori denied that this peculiarity of prophetic vision may have here characterized also the outlook of Jesus into the future which, as Mark 13:32 shows, was the prophetic outlook of His human nature as distinct from the Divine omniscience.

He did not represent salvation as something unconditioned, flowing simply from the love of God, which would overleap every necessity of mediation. The parable of the Prodigal Son, so often quoted to the contrary, furnishes, when rightly read, the clearest demonstration of this, for it was spoken to describe not God’s attitude toward sinners in the abstract, but the historic approach of God to lost men in the appearance of His Son Jesus. …"

In the New Testament the correct form is Gee’nna with the accent on the penult, not Ge’enna.

This has been done mainly on the ground before stated, that for the disciples the whole tenor of our Lord’s teaching represents the forgiveness of sins as unconditioned, assured by the gracious love of God as such.

On three occasions our Lord has brought out the spiritual significance of the physical salvation by calling special attention to its dependence on the exercise of faith: the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:34 = Matt. 9:22 = Luke 8:48), the blind man near Jericho (Mark 10:52 = Luke 18:42), one of the lepers (Luke 17:19).

With reference to this the two senses of the verb, “to be missing” and “to be destroyed,” are used side by side. From the point of view of man the judgment may bring a “losing” or a “finding,” “keeping” of the soul or life (Matt. 10:39, 16:25, Mark 8:35, Luke 9:24, 25, 17:33, John 12:25).

On the basis of our present Gospels, apart from critical reconstructions of the teaching of Jesus, no other view is possible than that our Lord represented salvation as in some way bound to and wrapped up in His Person. He did not represent salvation as something unconditioned, flowing simply from the love of God, which would overleap every necessity of mediation. The parable of the Prodigal Son, so often quoted to the contrary, furnishes, when rightly read, the clearest demonstration of this, for it was spoken to describe not God’s attitude toward sinners in the abstract, but the historic approach of God to lost men in the appearance of His Son Jesus. …"

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47).

But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

And in the same sense Jesus declares that the kingdom of God will be taken away from them and given to another nation (Matt. 21:43). He thus attaches Himself to the eschatological Old Testament usage.

With Paul the phrase bears preponderatingly an eschatological sense, although occasionally he uses it of the present state of believers (Romans 14: 17; 1 Corinthians 4:20; 6:9, 10; 15:24, 50; Galatians 5:21; Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 1:13; 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 2:12; 2 Thessalonians 1:5; 2 Timothy 4:1, 18). Elsewhere in the New Testament the eschatological use occurs in Hebrews 12:28; James 2:5; 2 Peter 1:11; Revelation 11:15.

The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament. There is this difference, that in the New Testament (already in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books) the conception is chiefly used with reference to the righteous dead, and has associated with it the thought of their blessed awaking in t …"

In each of these cases it denotes the final state of ruin and punishment which forms the opposite to salvation. The verb apolluein, from which the word is derived, has two meanings: (1) to lose; (2) to destroy. Both of these pass over to the noun, so that apoleia comes to signify: (1) loss; (2) ruin, destruction. The former occurs in Matthew 26:8; Mark 14:4, the latter in the passages cited above.

Only two groups are recognized, those of the condemned and of the saved (Matthew 25:33, 14; John 5:29); no intermediate group with as yet undetermined destiny anywhere appears. The degree of guilt is fixed according to the knowledge of the Divine will possessed in life (Matthew 10:15; 11:20-24; Luke 10:12-15; 12:47, 48; John 15:22, 24; Romans 2:12; 2 Peter 2:20-22).

None the less, the fourth line of thought is as prominent as in the canonical literature. The impression that the period of Judaism was to itself an un-pneumatic period is apt to be based on the comparison of these times with the immediately following Spiritfilled days of the early Christian church, rather than on an estimate of the period considered in itself. The “wise men” speak of themselves as “divine,” “immortal,” as the prophets of their age (Sap. Sol. 7:27, 8:13, Sir. 24:33). The apocalyptic writers also feel themselves men of a higher divine rank, initiated into mysteries hidden even from the angels, capable of forecasting the future, the authors of inspired writings (En. 14:3, 37:3, 82:2, 91:1, 92:1, 4 Ezra 14:18ff., 46, Slav.

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy. It cannot be a priori denied that this peculiarity of prophetic vision may have here characterized also the outlook of Jesus into the future which, as Mark 13:32 shows, was the prophetic outlook of His human nature as distinct from the Divine omniscience. The possibility of misinterpreting this feature and confounding sequence in perspective with chronological succession is in th …"

This was already partly so in the Old Testament (Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2). In the intervening Jewish literature the doctrine varies; sometimes a resurrection of the martyrs alone is taught (Enoch 90); sometimes of all the righteous dead of Israel (Psalms of Solomon 3:10; Enoch 91-94); sometimes of all the righteous and of some wicked Israelites (Enoch 1-36); sometimes of all the righteous and all the wicked (Ezra 4; 2 Esdras 5:45; 7:32).

In the same manner a difference in the degree or mode of punishment between the intermediate state and the age to come is plainly taught.

The distinction in Judaism rested on a consciousness of difference in quality between the two stages, the content of the Messianic age being far less spiritually and transcendentally conceived than that of the final state. The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present. In some cases this assumes explicit shape in the belief that great eschatological transactions have already begun to take place, and that believers have already attained to at least pa …

That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

The judgment assigns to each individual his eternal destiny, which is absolute in its character either of blessedness or of punishment, though admittedly of degrees within these two states. Only two groups are recognized, those of the condemned and of the saved (Matthew 25:33, 14; John 5:29); no intermediate group with as yet undetermined destiny anywhere appears. The degree of guilt is fixed according to the knowledge of the Divine will possessed in life (Matthew 10:15; 11:20-24; Luke 10:12-15; 12:47, 48; John 15:22, 24; Romans 2:12; 2 Peter 2:20-22).

An anthropomorphic description of the power of God is in the figures of “hand,” His “arm,” His “finger.” See “God.” 3. Other Modes of Expression: Some of the attributes of Yahweh have an intimate connection with His omnipotence. Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration.

Both in Nature and history, in creation and in redemption, it produces and controls and directs everything that comes to pass. Nothing in the realm of actual or conceivable things is withdrawn from it (Amos 9:2-3; Daniel 4:35); even to the minutest and most recondite sequences of cause and effect it extends and masters all details of reality (Matthew 10:30; Luke 12:7).

In the Fourth Gospel, it is true, He denies that His present activity involves the task of judging (John 8:15; 12:47). That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

The terms employed in 2 Peter 3:6-13 seem rather to imply that the renewal will out of the old produce a purified universe, whence also the catastrophe is compared to that of the Deluge. As then the old world perished by water and the present world arose out of the flood, so in the end-crisis “the heavens shall be dissolved by fire and the elements melt with fervent heat,” to give rise to the new heaven and the new earth in which righteousness dwells. The term palingenesia (Matthew 19:28) points to renewal, not to creation de novo.

The Parousia 1. Definition: The word denotes “coming,” “arrival.” It is never applied to the incarnation of Christ, and could be applied to His second coming only, partly because it had already become a fixed Messianic term, partly because there was a point of view from which the future appearance of Jesus appeared the sole adequate expression of His Messianic dignity and glory. The explicit distinction between “first advent” and “second advent” is not found in the New Testament. It occurs in Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Abraham 92:16. In the New Testament it is approached in Hebrews 9:28 and in the use of epiphaneia for both the past appearance of Christ and His future manifestation (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1; Titus 2:11, 13).

That this, however, does not exclude His eschatological judgeship appears from John 5:22, 27 (notice the article in 5:22 “the whole judgment,” which proves the reference to the last day). But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). A share of the judgment is assigned to angels and to the saints (Matthew 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Jude 1:14).

With Paul the phrase bears preponderatingly an eschatological sense, although occasionally he uses it of the present state of believers (Romans 14: 17; 1 Corinthians 4:20; 6:9, 10; 15:24, 50; Galatians 5:21; Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 1:13; 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 2:12; 2 Thessalonians 1:5; 2 Timothy 4:1, 18).

- ent (para_id=196, p_index=40): X. The Intermediate State In regard to the state of the dead, previously to the parousia and the resurrection, the New Testament is far less explicit than in its treatment of what belongs to general eschatology. The following points may here briefly be noted: (1) The state of death is frequently represented as a “sleeping,” just as the act of dying as a “falling asleep” (Matthew 9:24; John 9:4; 11:11; 1 Corinthians 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 15; 2 Peter 3:4). This usage, while also purely Greek, rests on the Old Testament. There is this difference, that in the New Testament (already in the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books) the conception is chiefly used with reference to the righteous dead, and has associated with it the thought of their blessed awaking in t …
- ent (para_id=198, p_index=42): inferred from 1 Corinthians 11:30; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, nevertheless Paul shrinks from it as from a relatively undesirable state, since it involves “nakedness” for the soul, which condition, however, does not exclude a relatively high degree of blessedness in fellowship with Christ (2 Corinthians 5: 2-4, 6, 8; Philippians 1:23). In the same manner a difference in the degree or mode of punishment between the intermediate state and the age to come is plainly taught. For on the one hand the eternal punishment is related to persons in the body (Matthew 10:28), and on the other hand it is assigned to a distinct place, Gehenna, which is never named in connection with the torment of the intermediate state. This term occurs in Matthew 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; Luke 12:5; 18:9; 23:33; Mark 9:43, 15, 47 …

Colossians 3:3 speaks of a “life . . . hid with Christ in God,” and of the “manifestation” of believers with Christ in glory at the parousia, but “life” does not imply bodily existence, and while the “manifestation” at the parousia presupposes the body, it does not imply that this body must have been acquired long before, as is the case with Christ’s body.

The conception now before us belongs to the commercial sphere. Of course, underneath both lies the more fundamental forensic mode of viewing the work of Christ, which corresponds to the Pauline idea of righteousness. It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work.

But even for the present, though not directly, yet indirectly by His appearance and message, Christ according to John effects a judgment among men (8:16; 9:39), which culminates in His passion and death, the judgment of the world and the Prince of the world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11).

The question is whether this mode of speaking can be explained on the principle of the well-known foreshortening of the perspective of prophecy.

The phrase “according to the working of Satan” excludes this, and “the lawless one” is a true human figure, “the man of sin” (or “the man of lawlessness,” according to another reading; compare the distinction between Satan and “the beast” in Revelation 20:10), Revelation 13:3.

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia. Of a judgment immediately after death, the New Testament nowhere speaks, not even in Hebrews 9:27, 28.

The arrival of these coincides with the sending of the Christ to the Jews, i.e. with the parousia.

The passage Revelation 20:1-6 at first sight much favors the conception of a millennial reign of Christ, participated in by the martyrs, brought to life in a first resurrection, and marked by a suspension of the activity of Satan. And it is urged that the sequence of visions places this millennium after the parousia of Christ narrated in Revelation 19.

The idea in substance is also found in Isaiah 51:16; Matthew 19:28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 12:26-28.

It must be remembered that the Old Testament has no single word for “universe,” and that the phrase “heaven and earth” serves to supply the deficiency.

These writers further assume that the cosmic eschatology was not indigenous among the Hebrews, but of oriental (Babylonian) origin, a theory which they apply not only to the more developed system of the later apocalyptic writings, but also to its preformations in the Old Testament.

While not confined to an astronomical day the judgment is plainly represented as a definitely circumscribed transaction, not as an indefinite process. It coincides with its parousia.

In John 5:34 also the preceding context revolves around the idea of life (vv. 21-29), and in the sequel the same idea is again brought forward (v. 39). Again, in 10:9, 10 “salvation” and “life” appear in close conjunction; 12:47 receives its interpretation from 3:17. The same difference as is observable with reference to eschatological salvation may be observed where present salvation is spoken of. Sometimes the conception is negative (Matt. 1:21, Luke 7:50), sometimes positive as well as negative (Luke 19:10); the salvation which came to Zacchaeus’ house certainly included more than pardon, since it issued in renewal of life.

It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work. We must remember that in the ancient world reduction to slavery as a consequence of guilt or debt was quite common. The terms which Paul uses t …
- pcred (para_id=521, p_index=4): law is the ransom Paul has in view. The principle of His active obedience is here actually enunciated, although this active obedience as here defined does not quite cover the range of the active obedience of the Mediator as defined in our dogmatic theology. It refers specifically to the ceremonial law as such, whence the positive counterpart of the slavery abolished is sonship rather than life.7 The objection has been brought to the view here taken, that Christ’s obedience to the ceremonial law did not begin with His birth. This objection lacks force for two reasons: (1) Paul could conceive of the birth of Christ as the natural introduction into the life of obedience; in virtue of His Jewish birth He was under the law, i.e., obliged to fulfill it as soon as He became capable of doing so.

- sipda (para_id=717, p_index=3): exhibition of the principle of sacrifice in the work of Christ and by the interpretation given thereof in the teachings of our Lord and of the apostolic writers. What Ritschl actually does, therefore, is to bring to the exegesis of Paul not the indubitable Old Testament truth, but his own individual appreciation of certain Old Testament facts, and it needs no special argument to show that this is an exegetically unfair and unsafe procedure. We must gather the apostle’s view through an independent study of his own words. In Romans 3:25 he says that God set forth Christ ilasthrion through faith in His blood. The first thing to observe is that these words are introduced to explain in what sense there is “redemption,” apolutrwsij, in Christ: “being justified freely by divine grace through the …
- sipda (para_id=718, p_index=4): equally bold combination occurs in the epistle to the Hebrews, and Paul by the emphatic phrase, “in his own blood,” has himself marked its peculiarity. One objection frequently raised against the view just stated ought to be briefly noticed. It is said that Paul, in case he wished to refer to something like the mercy seat, of which only one example existed, ought to have placed the article before ilasthrion. But this objection seems to us to miss the very point of the apostle’s suggestive representation. The underlying thought is precisely this, that the idea of the mercy seat has been embodied in two successive forms, first in that of the Old Testament ritual, subsequently in Christ. To Paul’s manner of thinking, the mercy seat is not a unicum but, since its idea is embodied in both type …
- sipda (para_id=719, p_index=5): dikaiosunh has in the passage before us a totally different meaning, has in fact nothing to do with the thought of penal recompense. This modern interpretation appears in a variety of forms with such writers as Ritschl, Cremer, Häring, and others. For our present purpose it is not necessary to examine these minor shades of difference. All the views referred to have this in common, that they make the righteousness of God here named bear a favorable meaning: it is defined as a form of grace or as a form of gracious procedure, whereby God imparts to man the benefits of salvation, not a righteousness held in balance by the divine love, not one of the two great factors entering into the redemptive process, but identical with love, and as such the sole principle from which the whole process flow …
- sipda (para_id=721, p_index=7): next, the Lord’s death appears as a covenant sacrifice: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” Ritschl concludes from this that the death of Christ cannot have had for Paul any more definite associations than those of a transaction introducing the New Testament church into the communion of God to which the forgiveness of sin is attached. Of course, a covenant sacrifice is a sacrifice which introduces into covenant fellowship, but this general statement leaves entirely undetermined the manner in which such introduction is effected. Now it is said that the body of Christ is uper umwn, and elsewhere this uper stands to express the sacrificial surrender of Christ on behalf of believers. Consequently Paul must have conceived of it as a rite of atonement, as well as a rite of introduction t …
- sipda (para_id=722, p_index=8): Christ gave Himself up in death for us. This act was the highest manifestation of His love towards us and is therefore held up as an example for the imitation of believers in their conduct towards one another. A further motive, however, for urging its imitation is derived from the fact that this act of Christ was supremely pleasing to God. Hence it is described in sacrificial terms not only, but in such sacrificial terms as strongly bring out this its character as something in which God takes delight; prosfora is placed before qusia (cf. for the usual sequence Heb. 10:5), and the phrase “for an odor of a sweet smell” is added, a phrase used by the law in connection with the whole burnt offering, in whose ritual the element of consecration was made prominent.

One who framed the comprehensive formula, “From him and through him and unto him are all things,” obviously derived the inspiration of his theology from his religion. Romans 1: 18-20 shows that all “truth” is ultimately truth concerning God. To find God everywhere of necessity leads to conceiving of all religious knowledge as organically one. This is the only standpoint which satisfactorily upholds the ideal value of theology and permanently sustains the theological impulse. Where it is not accepted, theology is apt to become even in the eyes of its friends a mere instrument for the salvation of man. At the same time the reference of all religious knowledge to God as its object of necessity imparts to the apostle’s theology an eminently practical purpose. Paul stands at the fu …"

Because believers live by the Spirit, they can be exhorted also to walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:25). Life is to Paul by no means an exclusively physical conception,38 as Romans 7:8-11 and Ephesians 4:18 will show.

Secondly, the close association of the ethico-religious function of the Spirit with life in itself creates a presumption in favor of the view that the future here, in part at least, colors the present. For “life” is undoubtedly with Paul, and before Paul with Jesus, especially in the Synoptical teaching, an idea that is in the first instance eschatologically conceived and thence carried back into the present.

This is transferred in the New Testament to the parousia of Christ. The phrase occurs only in Matthew 24:8; Mark 13:8, the idea, in Romans 8:22, and allusions to it occur probably in 1 Corinthians 7:26; 1 Thessalonians 3:3; 5:3.

It will be most correct, therefore, to speak of the military-forensic and the commercial-forensic representations given by the apostle of Christ’s objective saving work.

Here, it must be granted, the trend of his argument might seem to favor the modern assertion that in his best moments, when he most thoroughly disengaged himself from all Jewish prepossessions, the apostle actually proceeded to an unqualified negation of the forensic idea as applicable between man and God. In such a passage as Romans 3:27, “Where then is glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? Nay: but by a law of faith,” we seem to hear the religious idealist who associates reward as such with an impious sp …

With this in mind he reasons that Abraham cannot have had to glory toward God, not merely because the Scripture bears witness to the contrary, but also because it would have made God the debtor of a boastful man. Similarly in Romans 10:3 it is the inveterate Jewish pride which will not subject itself to the divine grace, because the latter collides with the love of self, to which Paul ascribes the historic failure of Judaism to attain the true ideal of righteousness. In view of all this it would not be wrong to say that the cause of the irreligiousness of the system of legalism was, in Paul’s view precisely the same as the cause of its impracticableness, viz., the sarx.

All the views referred to have this in common, that they make the righteousness of God here named bear a favorable meaning: it is defined as a form of grace or as a form of gracious procedure, whereby God imparts to man the benefits of salvation, not a righteousness held in balance by the divine love, not one of the two great factors entering into the redemptive process, but identical with love, and as such the sole principle from which the whole process flow …

This act was the highest manifestation of His love towards us and is therefore held up as an example for the imitation of believers in their conduct towards one another. A further motive, however, for urging its imitation is derived from the fact that this act of Christ was supremely pleasing to God. Hence it is described in sacrificial terms not only, but in such sacrificial terms as strongly bring out this its character as something in which God takes delight; prosfora is placed before qusia (cf. for the usual sequence Heb. 10:5), and the phrase “for an odor of a sweet smell” is added, a phrase used by the law in connection with the whole burnt offering, in whose ritual the element of consecration was made prominent.

It refers specifically to the ceremonial law as such, whence the positive counterpart of the slavery abolished is sonship rather than life.7 The objection has been brought to the view here taken, that Christ’s obedience to the ceremonial law did not begin with His birth. This objection lacks force for two reasons: (1) Paul could conceive of the birth of Christ as the natural introduction into the life of obedience; in virtue of His Jewish birth He was under the law, i.e., obliged to fulfill it as soon as He became capable of doing so.

It appears, therefore, that Paul’s thought was dwelling here upon the efficacy of the Savior’s death which extends to believers only. But believers are, according to Paul, involved in the sin and guilt of the race, and consequently the reconciliation which disposes of their sin and guilt must from the nature of the case bear also a racial, cosmical aspect.

The conclusion, therefore, is fully warranted that the Spirit as a living attestation of the state of righteousness in the believer has this significance, because He is in principle the fountain of the blessedness of the world to come. And this is verified by observing how Paul combines with righteousness the peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, and finds in this Spirit-fed peace and joy the essence of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17); how the first-fruit of the Spirit looks forward to the eschatological uioqesia (Rom. 8:23); how the katallagh and the resulting justificat …

That the idea in the Apostolic teaching largely revolves around the contrast between life and death, is made abundantly plain by the following passages: Acts 3:15, 5:30, 13:46, 47, Rom. 1:16, 17, 1 Cor. 5:5, 2 Cor. 2:15, 16, 7:10, Phil. 3:20, 2 Tim. 1:10, Titus 3:5, Heb. 5:7, James 5:15, 20, 1 Pet. 3:20, 21. Where the saving act is referred to a definite point of time, this is most frequently the eschatological future (Rom. 13:11, 1 Cor. 3:15, 5: 5, Phil. 1:28, 1 Thess. 5:8, 2 Thess. 2:13, Heb. 1:14, 2:10, 9:28, James 5:20, 1 Pet. …

Titus 3:7,Titus,3,7,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.",好叫我們因他的恩得稱為義，可以憑着永生的盼望成為後嗣〔或作：可以憑着盼望承受永生〕。,1,1,https://www.biblicaltheology.org/eapcs.pdf,"- eapcs (para_id=135, p_index=19): coloring. For in Christ this Spirit which is the seal and fruit of righteousness is none other than the Spirit of the consummate life and the consummate glory, the circumambient element of the eschatological state in general. The conclusion, therefore, is fully warranted that the Spirit as a living attestation of the state of righteousness in the believer has this significance, because He is in principle the fountain of the blessedness of the world to come. And this is verified by observing how Paul combines with righteousness the peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, and finds in this Spirit-fed peace and joy the essence of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17); how the first-fruit of the Spirit looks forward to the eschatological uioqesia (Rom. 8:23); how the katallagh and the resulting justificat …"
Zech 6:12,Zech,6,12,12,"And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord:",對他說，萬軍之耶和華如此說：看哪，那名稱為大衛苗裔的，他要在本處長起來，並要建造耶和華的殿。,1,1,https://www.biblicaltheology.org/pch.pdf,"- pch (para_id=488, p_index=1): “The Priesthood of Christ in the Epistle to the Hebrews” The Princeton Theological Review 5:423-447, 579-604. [1907] The Epistle to the Hebrews deals mainly with the two great offices of Christ as Revealer and as Priest. It is clear that the author consciously coordinates the two. In the opening verses, which serve as a prelude to the entire Epistle, we have side by side: “God spake in a Son” and “Having made purification of sins He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.” But especially 3: 1 is interesting from this point of view. Here the Savior is called “Apostle and High Priest of our confession.” The article, put only once, binds the two conceptions most closely together: He is Apostle and High Priest in one, and His chief value for the believer consists in His being the tw …"
Zech 8:6,Zech,8,6,6,"Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the Lord of hosts.",萬軍之耶和華如此說：到那日，這事在餘剩的民眼中看為希奇，在我眼中也看為希奇嗎？這是萬軍之耶和華說的。,1,1,https://www.biblicaltheology.org/omnipotence.pdf,"- omnipotence (para_id=441, p_index=2): impotent idols (1 Samuel 17:26, 36; 2 Kings 19:4, 16; Psalm 18:46; Jeremiah 23:36; Daniel 6:20, 26). An anthropomorphic description of the power of God is in the figures of “hand,” His “arm,” His “finger.” See “God.” 3. Other Modes of Expression: Some of the attributes of Yahweh have an intimate connection with His omnipotence. Under this head especially God’s nature as Spirit and His holiness come under consideration. The representation of God as Spirit in the Old Testament does not primarily refer to the incorporealness of the divine nature, but to its inherent energy. The physical element underlying the conception of Spirit is that of air in motion, and in this at first not the invisibility but the force forms the point of comparison. The opposite of “Spirit” in this sense is “flesh,” w …"
